To define attributes for input (e.g. `style` or `placeholder`) you can define them
on the original element with `e-*` prefix (e.g. `e-style` or `e-placeholder`).  
When input will appear these attributes will be transferred to it.  
To customize the classes on the form the input is in, add `e-formclass` with the classes to be added.  
To use simple bootstrap input groups add either `e-inputgroupleft` or `e-inputgroupright` with the text value you want to append.
