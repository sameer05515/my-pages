            <h2>What is Dev-Ops?</h2>
            <p><span>The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations.
                    This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development
                    to&nbsp;</span><strong>testing, deployment</strong><span>,
                    and&nbsp;</span><strong>operations</strong><span>. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection
                    between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.</span></p>
            <p>DevOps helps to increase organization speed to deliver applications and services. It also allows
                organizations to serve their customers better and compete more strongly in the market.</p>
            <p>DevOps can also be defined as a sequence of development and IT operations with better communication and
                collaboration.</p>
            <p>DevOps has become one of the most valuable business disciplines for enterprises or organizations. With
                the help of DevOps,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>quality</strong>,
                and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>speed</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of the application delivery has improved
                to a great extent.</p>
            <p>DevOps is nothing but a practice or methodology of making "<strong>Developers</strong>" and
                "<strong>Operations</strong>" folks work together. DevOps represents a change in the IT culture with a
                complete focus on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile practices in the context of a
                system-oriented approach.</p>
            <p>DevOps is all about the integration of the operations and development process. Organizations that have
                adopted DevOps noticed a 22% improvement in software quality and a 17% improvement in application
                deployment frequency and achieve a 22% hike in customer satisfaction. 19% of revenue hikes as a result
                of the successful DevOps implementation.</p>

            <h2 id="Why" class="h2">Why DevOps?</h2>
            <p>Before going further, we need to understand why we need the DevOps over the other methods.</p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>The operation and development team worked in complete isolation.</li>
                <li>After the design-build, the testing and deployment are performed respectively. That's why they
                    consumed more time than actual build cycles.</li>
                <li>Without the use of DevOps, the team members are spending a large amount of time on designing,
                    testing, and deploying instead of building the project.</li>
                <li>Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production.</li>
                <li>Coding and operation teams have their separate timelines and are not in synch, causing further
                    delays.</li>

            <p>Here are some advantages and disadvantages that DevOps can have for business, such as:</p>

            <div class="box-prem">
                <h3 class="h3">Advantages</h3>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>DevOps is an excellent approach for quick development and deployment of applications.</li>
                    <li>It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.</li>
                    <li>DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.

            </div>
            <div class="box-prem">
                <h3 class="h3">Disadvantages</h3>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>DevOps professional or expert's developers are less available.</li>
                    <li>Developing with DevOps is so expensive.</li>
                    <li>Adopting new DevOps technology into the industries is hard to manage in short time.</li>

            <div class="box-yellow">
                <h3 class="h3">1) Build</h3>
                <p>Without DevOps, the cost of the consumption of the resources was evaluated based on the pre-defined
                    individual usage with fixed hardware allocation. And with DevOps, the usage of cloud, sharing of
                    resources comes into the picture, and the build is dependent upon the user's need, which is a
                    mechanism to control the usage of resources or capacity.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">2) Code</h3>
                <p>Many good practices such as Git enables the code to be used, which ensures writing the code for
                    business, helps to track changes, getting notified about the reason behind the difference in the
                    actual and the expected output, and if necessary reverting to the original code developed. The code
                    can be appropriately arranged in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>files, folders</strong>, etc. And they
                    can be reused.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">3) Test</h3>
                <p>The application will be ready for production after testing. In the case of manual testing, it
                    consumes more time in testing and moving the code to the output. The testing can be automated, which
                    decreases the time for testing so that the time to deploy the code to production can be reduced as
                    automating the running of the scripts will remove many manual steps.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">4) Plan</h3>
                <p>DevOps use Agile methodology to plan the development. With the operations and development team in
                    sync, it helps in organizing the work to plan accordingly to increase productivity.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">5) Monitor</h3>
                <p>Continuous monitoring is used to identify any risk of failure. Also, it helps in tracking the system
                    accurately so that the health of the application can be checked. The monitoring becomes more
                    comfortable with services where the log data may get monitored through many third-party tools such
                    as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Splunk</strong>.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">6) Deploy</h3>
                <p>Many systems can support the scheduler for automated deployment. The cloud management platform
                    enables users to capture accurate insights and view the optimization scenario, analytics on trends
                    by the deployment of dashboards.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">7) Operate</h3>
                <p>DevOps changes the way traditional approach of developing and testing separately. The teams operate
                    in a collaborative way where both the teams actively participate throughout the service lifecycle.
                    The operation team interacts with developers, and they come up with a monitoring plan which serves
                    the IT and business requirements.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">8) Release</h3>
                <p>Deployment to an environment can be done by automation. But when the deployment is made to the
                    production environment, it is done by manual triggering. Many processes involved in release
                    management commonly used to do the deployment in the production environment manually to lessen the
                    impact on the customers.</p>

            <div class="box-yellow">
                <h3 class="h3">AWS CloudFormation</h3>
                <p>DevOps team is required to create and release cloud instances and services more frequently in
                    comparison to development teams. Templates of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, ECS containers,
                    and S3 storage buckets let you set up the entire stack without having to bring everything together.
