            <p>Bitbucket Pipelines is an integrated CI/CD service built into Bitbucket. It allows you to automatically
                build, test, and even deploy your code based on a configuration file in your repository. Essentially, we
                create containers in the cloud for you. Inside these containers, you can run commands (like you might on
                a local machine) but with all the advantages of a fresh system, customized and configured for your
                needs.</p>
