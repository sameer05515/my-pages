            <h3>7) What is difference between PrintWriter and ServletOutputStream?</h3>

            <p>PrintWriter is a character-stream class where as ServletOutputStream is a byte-stream class. The
                PrintWriter class can be used to write only character-based information whereas ServletOutputStream
                class can be used to write primitive values as well as character-based information.</p>

            <h3>8) What is difference between GenericServlet and HttpServlet?</h3>

            <p>The GenericServlet is protocol independent whereas HttpServlet is HTTP protocol specific. HttpServlet

            <hr />
            <h3>9) What is servlet collaboration?</h3>

            <p>When one servlet communicates to another servlet, it is known as servlet collaboration. There are many
                ways of servlet collaboration:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>RequestDispacher interface</li>
                <li>sendRedirect() method etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) What is the purpose of RequestDispatcher Interface?</h3>

            <p>The RequestDispacher interface provides the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it
                may be html, servlet or jsp. This interceptor can also be used to include the content of antoher
                resource.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>11) Can you call a jsp from the servlet?</h3>

            <p>Yes, one of the way is RequestDispatcher interface for example:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>RequestDispatcher&nbsp;rd=request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/login.jsp&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>rd.forward(request,response);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>forward() method</th>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1) forward() sends the same request to another resource.</td>
                        <td>1) sendRedirect() method sends new request always because it uses the URL bar of the
                            browser.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2) forward() method works at server side.</td>
                        <td>2) sendRedirect() method works at client side.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>3) forward() method works within the server only.</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <hr />
            <h3>13) What is difference between ServletConfig and ServletContext?</h3>

            <p>The container creates object of ServletConfig for each servlet whereas object of ServletContext is
                created for each web application.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>14) What is Session Tracking?</h3>

            <p><strong>Session</strong>&nbsp;simply means a particular interval of time.</p>

            <p>Session Tracking is a way to maintain state of an user.Http protocol is a stateless protocol.Each time
                user requests to the server, server treats the request as the new request.So we need to maintain the
                state of an user to recognize to particular user.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>17) What is filter?</h3>

            <p>A filter is an object that is invoked either at the preprocessing or postprocessing of a request. It is

            <h3>21) What is load-on-startup in servlet?</h3>

            <p>The load-on-startup element of servlet in web.xml is used to load the servlet at the time of deploying

            <p><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/load-on-startup">more details...</a></p>

            <hr />
            <h3>22) What if we pass negative value in load-on-startup?</h3>

            <p>It will not affect the container, now servlet will be loaded at first request.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>23) What is war file?</h3>

            <p>A war (web archive) file specifies the web elements. A servlet or jsp project can be converted into a war
                file. Moving one servlet project from one place to another will be fast as it is combined into a single
                file.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/war-file">more details...</a></p>

            <hr />
            <h3>24) How to create war file?</h3>

            <p>The war file can be created using jar tool found in jdk/bin directory. If you are using Eclipse or
                Netbeans IDE, you can export your project as a war file.</p>

            <p>To create war file from console, you can write following code.</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>jar&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;abc.war&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now all the files of current directory will be converted into abc.war file.</p>
