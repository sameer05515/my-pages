            <h2>JasperReports Interview Questions</h2>

            <p><strong>Question 1. What Is The Difference Between Ireport And Jasperreport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>Basically iReport is the report designer and JasperReport is the reporting engine.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Question 2. How Are Jasperreports And Ireports Created?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>Jasper Reports are created manually using jrxml file and compliling it. On the other hand iReport gives
                one the more user-friendly environment for developing reports.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>


            <p><strong>Question 3. How To Determine The Version Of Java Used By Ireport Designers In An
                    Environment?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>In order to determine the specific version of Java used by the installation of iReport designer, the
                setting in thecon/ireporpro.con or in the ireport/etc/ireportpro. con should be used.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Question 4. What Are The Steps For Identifying The Default Java Version Used For Generating
                    Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>When iReprot designer is using the default Java installation for the environment, opening a command line
                and executing the following command would help &ndash; java-version</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 5. What Is The Command Line For Setting Jdkhome Specifically For Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>When the jdkhome is set specifically for the iReport, opening a command line and going to the bin
                directory within the listed directories in the setting for executing the command java-version would help
                identifying the java version.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 6. How To Change The Version Of Java Used By The Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>To change the version of Java used by iReport, the following setting has to be added or updated.<br />
                &lt;irepor-install-directory&gt;/fonf/ireportpro.conf<br />
                or &lt;ireport-install-directory&gt;/ireport/etc/ireportpro.conf.<br />
                The use of the command line would depend on the installation made.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Question 7. What Are The Restrictions For Using Command Line For Changing The Version Of Java
                    Used By Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>User must ensure that the command line does not have any hash at the beginning of the line after it is
                updated. Because in such case it would no more be command line but would become comment only.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 8. Can Jre Be Selected To Generate Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>JRE was created using the JSmooth and one can modify the file ireport/etc/ireport.jsmooth using the
                jsmooth to force use of particular JVM.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Question 9. How To Solve The Problem Of Running Ireport When It Generates Java Error?</strong>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>The config file is available in the etc folder where the jdkhome has been set. The path that is to be
                given there is the jdk path and not jre path. Installation of jdk is essential for the purpose.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 10. How To Resolve The Windows Installer Problem In Java?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>User has to first check whether he or she is running the program in a container or as standalone.
                Checking this would enable the person to get the right JAVA_HOME version for running the iReport.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 11. How To Add User Defined Functions In Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>Scriptlets are the bridges that get the Java Code in iReport. iReport.scriptlet is a Java class that
                extends JRDefaultScriptlet where one can write user defined functions that can later be accessed easily
                in the report.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 13. How To Run User Defined Functions In Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>A few simple steps help to run the user defined functions. The first step is to go to Tools-options-
                claspath tab &ndash;ADD Jar- choose Jar file. In iReport the Scriptlet node in Report Inspector chooses
                the property named &lsquo;Scriplet Class&rsquo;. Keying in the location of the user defined function
                would help.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 14. What Is Jar?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>In iReport JAR is made on building the project containing the Scriptlet.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Question 15. What Is The Specific Necessity Of The Class Containing User Defined
                    Function?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>The class containing the user defined functions needs to be extended by the JRDefaultScriptlet.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 16. What Is The Parameter For Using User Defined Function In Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>The parameter in iReport for using the user defined function is $P{REPORT SCRIPTLET} which is a
                predefined parameter for the user.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 17. What Is The Process Of Using User Defined Function In Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>The user defined function is used with the $ P{REPORT SCRIPTLET}.userDefinedFun(). This function returns
                values from the scriptlet.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 18. What Are Other User Defined Functions Used In Ireport?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>Other user defined functions in iReport are $P{REPORT SCRIPTLET}.userDefinedfun($F{field}). These
                functions give fluidity to Java from the Jasper to Java code.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><strong>Question 19. Is There Any Way To Know How The Report Looks?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>Jasper Reports is used to generate the reports from the Database. A powerful report-generating tool that
                has the ability to deliver rich content onto the screen, to the printer or into PDF, HTML, XLS, CSV and
                XML files. Its main use is to help creating page oriented, ready to print documents in a simple flexible
                manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Question 42. What Is Ireport Designer?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p>

            <p>There are several ways to add reporting capabilities to an application. For many web developers, to
                create a report just means to create a web page, which produces good results on screen but poor results
                when printed to paper. And to create a report in PDF means write more code tons of code, making the
                reports hard to maintain and long to write.</p>

            <p>When working with other technologies the problem does not change very much. For example, Java provides an
                extensive API for printing, but there is still a lot of work to write specific code for each document
                format.The answer to this problem is to use a reporting library.JasperReports Library is the
                world&rsquo;s most popular open source Java reporting library, and iReport Designer is a visual report
                designer for JasperReports.</p>

            <p>The library is a report engine that can be integrated in your open or commercial application to generate
                the reports designed with iReport Designer, display them on screen or export them in a final format like
                PDF, OpenOffice, DOCX and many others. Alternatively, you can stream the result through a web
                application or send the final document directly to a printer.</p>

            <p>JasperReports is in some way the core of iReport Designer. JasperReports is extremely easy to integrate
                in an Java application, but if you need an environment to use the reports without having to write a
                custom application, you may consider using JasperReports Server.</p>

            <p>JasperServer provides a web based interface to manage, schedule, and run the reports; a repository to
                store all the report resources like images, fonts, data sources and much more; a security service to
                decide who can execute which report; and a web services API to execute the reports from external
                applications (so you can generate reports from any kind of environment, like PHP or .NET).</p>

            <p>In the big picture, iReport Designer allows you to design reports, JasperReports allows to execute them
                and generate output in a Java application, and JasperServer allows both end users and external
                applications to access, view, and publish your reports securely. JasperServer also makes reports
                interactive by adding drill down and drill up capabilities to your documents.</p>

                marts and warehouses. And it easily keeps pace with the performance of other leading ETL tools.</p>

            <p>With JasperETL, database architects and operational data store administrators can: Use the business
                modeler to access a non-technical view of the information workflow. Display and edit the ETL process
                with Job Designer, a graphical editing tool. Define complex mappings and transformations with
                Transformation Mapper and other transformation components.</p>

            <p>Generate portable Perl or Java code that can be executed on any machine. Track ETL statistics from start
                to finish with real-time debugging. Allow simultaneous output from and input to multiple sources
                including flat files, XML files, databases, web services, POP and FTP servers with hundreds of available
                connectors. Configure heterogeneous data sources and complex file formats including positional,
                delimited, CSV, RegExp, XML, and LDIF with metadata wizards. Use the Activity Monitoring Console (AMC)
                to monitor job events (successes, failures, warnings, etc.), execution times, and data volumes.</p>
