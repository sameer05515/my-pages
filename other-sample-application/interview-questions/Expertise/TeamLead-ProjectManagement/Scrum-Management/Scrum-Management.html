            <h2>Sprints</h2>

            <p><em>A sprint is a fixed time period in a continuous development cycle where teams complete work from
                    their product backlog. At the end of the sprint, a team will typically have built and implemented a
                    working product increment. Jira Software makes your backlog the center of your sprint planning
                    meeting, so you can estimate stories, adjust sprint scope, check velocity, and re-prioritize issues
                    in real-time.</em></p>

            <h2>How to plan and execute scrum sprints</h2>

            </p>

            <p>The scrum folks really did think of everything. In order to plan your upcoming sprint, you use the sprint
                planning meeting!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning">Sprint
                    planning</a>&nbsp;is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: What work can
                get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?</p>

            <h2>Do&#39;s and Don&rsquo;ts</h2>

            <p>Even with the basics down, most teams will stumble as they start to run sprints. Megan Cook rounds out
                this discussion with some Do&#39;s and Don&rsquo;ts she&#39;s picked up over the years.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Do:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured. This is
                    the key to keeping everyone aligned and moving forward toward a common destination.</li>
                <li>Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order. This can
                    be a big challenge that could derail the process if it&rsquo;s not properly managed.</li>
                <li>Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity, and that it reflects things like leave and team
                    meetings.</li>
                <li>Do use the sprint planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
                    Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the
                    sprint.</li>
                <li>Leave out work where you won&rsquo;t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another
                    team, designs, and legal sign-off.</li>
                <li>Finally, once a decission or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your
                    project management or collaboration tool, like your Jira tickets. That way, both the decision and
                    the rationale are easy for everyone to see later.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While you&rsquo;re working on being a scrum all-star with these &ldquo;do&rsquo;s,&rdquo; watch out for a
                few red flags too:</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can&rsquo;t be
                    completed in the sprint. You don&rsquo;t want to set yourself or your team up for failure.</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature
                    work, like bugs and engineering health.</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t let the team have a fuzzy view of what&#39;s in the sprint. Nail it down, and
                    don&rsquo;t focus so much on moving&nbsp;<em>fast</em>&nbsp;that you forget to make sure
                    everyone&rsquo;s moving in&nbsp;<em>the same direction</em>.</li>
                <li>Also, don&rsquo;t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are
                    large or have high uncertainty, and don&#39;t be afraid to leave some of that work for the next
                    sprint.</li>
                <li>If you hear concerns from the team, whether it&rsquo;s about velocity, low-certainty work, or work
                    they think is bigger than what they estimated, don&rsquo;t ignore it. Address the issue, and
                    recalibrate when necessary.</li>
            </ul>
