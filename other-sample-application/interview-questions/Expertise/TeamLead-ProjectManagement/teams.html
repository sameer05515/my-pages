            <h1>Most Asked Scrum Master Interview Questions</h1>

            <p>Following is a list of most frequently asked Scrum Master Interview questions and their best possible
                answers.</p>

            <h3>1) What do you understand by Scrum?</h3>

            <p>Scrum is an Agile framework that is used for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It
                is mainly used for software development, but we can use it in other fields such as research, sales,
                marketing, and advanced technologies. It is designed to help teams work together.</p>

            <p>Scrum is generally used for teams of ten or fewer members who break their work and set small goals which
                they can complete within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, most commonly in two weeks, and
                sometimes maximum time is one month.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>2) What is the Daily Scrum?</h3>

            <p>The Scrum Team is used to do a daily 15-minute time-boxed meeting to track their task progress. This
                routine is called Daily Scrum. At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review to demonstrate
                the work done and a sprint retrospective to improve continuously.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>3) What is the main usage of Scrum?</h3>

            <p>Scrum can make teams able to learn from experiences, self-organize while working on problems, reflect on
                their victories and failures, and make improvements.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>4) What is Agile in software development?</h3>

            <p>In Software development, Agile is a collective framework of approaches and behaviors that encourage
                iterative development and collaboration between self-organizing teams. This practice involves
                discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing
                and cross-functional teams and their end-users.</p>

            <p>Agile mainly focuses on adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual
                improvement. It also encourages flexible responses to changes.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>5) What are the different roles in Scrum?</h3>

            <p>Following are the three different roles in Scrum:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong>&nbsp;The first role is the product owner. This is an individual
                    responsible for increasing the ROI by determining product features, prioritizing these features into
                    a list, focusing on the upcoming sprint, and other things. These are constantly re-prioritized and
                    refined.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong>&nbsp;The Scrum Master is used to help the team learn how to apply
                    Scrum to ensure optimum business value. The responsibility of scrum master is to remove impediments,
                    shield the team from distractions, and make them able to adopt agile practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrum Team:</strong>&nbsp;The Scrum Team is a collection of individuals who work together to
                    ensure the stakeholders&#39; requirements on time.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>6) What are the main responsibilities of the Scrum Team?</h3>

            <p>The Scrum Team is a self-organizing team that involves five to seven members (always less than ten
                members).</p>

            <p>Following are some key responsibilities of the Scrum Team:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It is a must to develop and deliver working products during each sprint.</li>
                <li>It is a must to ensure ownership and transparency for the work assigned to the team members.</li>
                <li>The Scrum Team has to provide correct and crisp information to ensure a successful daily scrum
                    meeting.</li>
                <li>Collaboration between team members is a must.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>7) What is the difference between Agile and Scrum?</h3>

                    <tr>
                        <td>In Agile, a project head has to take care of all tasks and is vital to the project.</td>
                        <td>In Scrum, there is no leader. Here, the scrum master and the team have to handle the issues.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <hr />
            <h3>8) What are some other frameworks of Agile rather than Scrum?</h3>

            <p>Some other Agile frameworks rather than Scrum are kanban (which uses kanban boards), test-driven
                development, and feature-driven development.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>9) What are the Artifacts of the Scrum Process?</h3>

            <p>There are mainly three artifacts of the Scrum process discussed below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong>&nbsp;The Product Backlog is a list that contains new features,
                    changes to features, bug fixes, changes to the infrastructure, and other activities to ensure that
                    we can get an individual output.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong>&nbsp;The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog. It
                    contains tasks that the team has focused on to satisfy the sprint goal. Teams first identify the
                    tasks that they have completed from the product backlog and then added them to the sprint backlog.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product Increment:</strong>&nbsp;Product Increment is a combination of all product backlog
                    items completed in a sprint and the value of previous sprints&#39; increments. The output must be in
                    a usable condition without minding it if the product owner doesn&#39;t release it.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) What are the key differences between Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog?</h3>

            <p>Following are the key differences between Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog:</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>

                        <td>The Product Backlog is a list of items that you have to complete to develop the product.
                        </td>
                        <td>The Sprint Backlog is a list of items that we have to complete during each Sprint.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>In Product Backlog, the product owner collects the backlog from the customer and is assigned
                            to the team.</td>
                        <td>In Sprint Backlog, the team collects the backlog from the product owner and sets up
                            Sprint&#39;s time frame.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>In Product Backlog, the product owner maintains the backlog until the Project is complete.
                        </td>
                        <td>In Sprint Backlog, each new Sprint has backlogs added by the team.</td>

            <h3>11) What do you understand by Scrum Master? / Who is a Scrum Master?</h3>

            <p>Scrum Master is a unique position of a person who is used to promote and support the usage of Scrum
                within the team.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) What does a Scrum Master do? / What is the role of a Scrum Master?</h3>

                <li>Make sure that the team delivers value during the Sprint.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>13) What do you understand by the user story in Scrum?</h3>

            <p>A user story is a tool used in Scrum (Agile software development) that captures a feature&#39;s
                description from an end-user perspective. A user story is used to create a simplified description of a
                user&#39;s requirements.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>14) What happens in Daily Stand-up sessions in Scrum?</h3>

            <p>In Scrum, every day a stand-up sessions or a discussion takes place, usually for 15 minutes. These Daily
                Stand-up sessions are used to understand the following things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Which tasks are going well?</li>
                <li>Which tasks were completed?</li>
                <li>Which tasks are pending?</li>
                <li>It also specifies the obstacles the team is facing.</li>
                <li>This meeting also helps to understand the overall scope and status of the Project.</li>
                <li>Further discussions can take place after the stand-up sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>15) What is Scrum-ban?</h3>

            <p>Scrum-ban is a combination of Scrum and Kanban. It is a methodology used to fulfill the team&#39;s
                requirements, minimize the batching of work, and adopt a pull-based system. It contains the structure of
                Scrum and the flexibility and visualization of Kanban.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>16) Why Scrum testers encourage automated testing for the Project?</h3>

            <p>Scrum prefers to use automated performance or regression testing to deliver software as fast as possible.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>17) What do you understand by Sprint 0 and Spike?</h3>

            <p><strong>Sprint 0:</strong>&nbsp;Sprint 0 specifies the small amount of effort used to create a rough
                skeleton of the product backlog. It also specifies insights towards estimating the release of products.
                Sprint 0 is required for the following reasons:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It is used to create the project skeleton, along with research spikes.</li>
                <li>Keep the design minimal.</li>
                <li>It is used to develop some stories.</li>
                <li>It is used because of its low velocity and being lightweight.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Spike:</strong>&nbsp;The spike is a set of activities that involve Extreme Programming (XP) for
                research, design, investigation, creating POCs, etc. It is mainly used to reduce the technical approach
                risks and gain knowledge to understand requirements better and improve reliability.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>18) What is User-Story Mapping in Scrum?</h3>

            <p>In Scrum, User-Story Mapping is used to represent and arrange user stories in such a way that we can
                easily understand system functionalities, system backlog, planning releases, and providing value to
                customers. User stories are arranged according to their priority on the horizontal axis. On the vertical
                axis, the user stories are represented in the increasing levels of sophistication.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>19) Who writes user stories?</h3>

            <p>Generally, it is the product owner&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the product backlog of agile user
                stories exists. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the product owner can only write them. So, anyone can
                write user stories.</p>

            <p><strong>Process of writing user stories</strong></p>

            <p>When the product discussions start, the team talks about the requirements and captures those in user
                stories. A product backlog is always live and never stays frozen so, if anyone feels there is a missing
                requirement or something that can add value to the client, they can add it up as a user story in the
                backlog. No rule or guideline is specifying that only the product owner can write the user stories.
                People writing the story should understand what it means and how to write it, as there is a set format.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>20) What are the advantages of writing user stories?</h3>

            <p>The biggest advantage of writing user stories is that if anyone writes user stories, it gives a sense of
                ownership to those members as they can connect if they are involved in the writing process. We can write
                user stories all through Agile development.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>21) What do you understand by &#39;Scrum of Scrums&#39;?</h3>

            <p>The terminology &#39;Scrum of Scrums&#39; is used for scaled agile technologies required for controlling
                and collaborating with multiple scrum teams. It is most efficient in situations where teams are
                collaborating on complex assignments.</p>

            <p>It also ensures that the required transparency, collaboration, adaption, and adoption are established,
                and the products are deployed and delivered.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>22) What is the general age of the Sprints?</h3>

            <p>A sprint is generally one month or less when a usable and potentially releasable product increment is
                created. But a sprint can be as short as a week or two weeks as average.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>23) What do you understand by a Sprint Retrospective?</h3>

            <p>The sprint retrospective is a type of meeting that takes place after the sprint review. Here, the team
                discusses past mistakes, potential issues, and new methods to handle them. This data is incorporated
                into the planning of a new sprint.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>24) What are the main drawbacks or disadvantages of using Scrum?</h3>

            <p>Following is the list of some biggest drawbacks or disadvantages of using Scrum:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Scrum requires a team of experienced individuals.</li>
                <li>The Scrum team needs to be collaborative and committed to providing precise results.</li>
                <li>A team lacking experience or a scrum master with lesser experience can cause the collapse of the
                    project.</li>
                <li>We have to define tasks well; otherwise, the project may provide inaccuracies.</li>
                <li>Scrum works better for smaller projects, but it isn&#39;t easy to scale to larger and more complex
                    projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>25) Is it possible for someone to change a requirement?</h3>

            <p>Yes, anyone can make changes in Scrum. Scrum requires a lot of feedback from both customers and
                stakeholders to improve the product. So, changes can be used to make the project better and faster.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>26) How can you deal with the Scrum Team?</h3>

            <p>We should follow the steps given below to deal with the Scrum Team:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We have to identify and address the issue&#39;s root cause.</li>
                <li>We have to establish complete ownership.</li>
                <li>Try to diffuse the disagreement.</li>

                <li>We have to emphasize focus areas that complement the project.</li>
                <li>There should be a common understanding required to guide the team.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>27) What is the difference between user stories, epics, and tasks?</h3>

            <p>Following are the differences between user stories, epics, and tasks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Stories:</strong>&nbsp;User Stories are used to provide the team a simple explanation
                    of the business&#39; requirements created from the end user&#39;s perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Epics:</strong>&nbsp;An epic is a collection of related user stories which are usually large
                    and complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Tasks:</strong>&nbsp;A task is the smallest unit in Scrum that is used to track work. It is
                    a breakdown of user stories further. Usually, a person or a team of two people work on a task.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>28) What do you understand by Sprint and Velocity in Scrum?</h3>

            <p>In Scrum, Sprint is a terminology used to describe a time-boxed iteration. A specific module or feature
                of the product is created in the Sprint process. The duration of a sprint can be a week or two weeks. On
                the other hand, Velocity is a metric used to measure the amount of work completed by a team during a
                Sprint. It specifies the number of user stories completed in a Sprint.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>29) What are the different responsibilities of a Product Owner?</h3>

            <p>Following is a list of some essential responsibilities of a Product Owner:</p>

                <li>A Product Owner has to anticipate the needs of the customer and create appropriate user stories.
                </li>
                <li>A Product Owner is responsible for the progress of the project.</li>
                <li>A Product Owner has to answer all product-related questions.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>30) What are a Burnup and Burndown Chart in Scrum?</h3>

            <p><strong>Burnup Chart:</strong>&nbsp;A burnup chart is a tool used to track the amount of work completed.
                It also represents the total amount of work that needs to be done for a sprint/project.</p>

            <p><strong>Burndown Chart:</strong>&nbsp;A burndown chart is used to represent the working through user
                stories. It shows total effort against the amount of work for each iteration.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>31) How would you estimate the user stories in a Scrum Project?</h3>

            <p>In a Scrum project, user stories&#39; estimation can be done according to their difficulty. A particular
                scale is used to assess the difficulty of the user stories. Following are some types of scales:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Numeric Sizing (1 - 10)</li>
                <li>T-shirt Sizes (S, M, L, XL&hellip;)</li>
                <li>Fibonacci Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8&hellip;)</li>
                <li>Dog breeds (Great Dane, Pug&hellip;)</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>32) How can you deal with Score Creep?</h3>

            <p>The term Score creep is used to specify a change that is uncontrolled and added without checking its
                impact on scope, time, cost, etc.</p>

            <p>We have to follow the steps given below to handle it well:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We have to monitor the work being done on a day-to-day basis closely.</li>
                <li>A clear understanding and communicating with the team about the vision and ensuring they&#39;re
                    aligned.</li>
                <li>Capturing, reviewing the project requirements regularly to emphasize the needs signed off to the
                    team and customer.</li>
                <li>We have to ensure that any changes introduced go through change control, and we have to implement
                    them according to the approval for change request.</li>
                <li>Avoid gold plating.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>33) What are the different types of risks in Scrum? How can you handle them?</h3>

            <p>Following are some important types of risks in Scrum:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Budget: It specifies the risk of exceeding budgets.</li>
                <li>People (team): It specifies that the team members must have appropriate skills and capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>Sprint (duration and deliverables): It is used to specify the duration and addition of the work
                    scope.</li>
                <li>Product (user stories, epics): It specifies all ill-defined user stories and epics.</li>
                <li>Knowledge and capability: It is used to specify the appropriate resources.</li>
                <li>Managing risks involves identifying, assessing, analyzing, defining, and implementing risk
                    responses, monitoring, and managing them.</li>
                <li>The team does all the above things continually right from the project&#39;s start until completion.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Note: It is essential to understand that the risk&#39;s impact is based on the proximity of the actual
                occurrence of the risk.</h4>

            <hr />
            <h3>34) What are the full form of MVP and MMP? What is their usage?</h3>

            <p><strong>MVP</strong>&nbsp;stands for Minimum Viable Product. It is a Lean Startup concept used to stress
                the impact of learning while performing product development. It allows one to test and understand the
                idea by getting exposed to the initial version for target customers and users. To get this, one has to
                collect all the relevant data and learn from that collected data. It is mainly used to produce the
                product, provide access to the users, and observe how the product is used, perceived, and understood. It
                also offers more insight into the customer&#39;s or user&#39;s need.</p>

            <p><strong>MMP</strong>&nbsp;stands for Minimal Marketable Product. It is used to specify the product&#39;s
                description, which will have a minimal number of features that address the users&#39; requirements. It
                also helps an organization to reduce the time to market.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>35) Is Scrum Master a management-level position?</h3>

            <p>Yes, the Scrum Master is a management-level position, but it is not a manager position exactly. The role
                of the Scrum Master is to manage the Scrum process, not the Scrum Team or even the Development Team. If
                the Scrum Master is not in the management position, he/she may not have the power to remove the
                impediments.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>36) How does a Scrum Master track the progress of the Sprint?</h3>

            <p>Following are some ways that a Scrum Master uses to track the progress of the Sprint:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Daily Scrum meetings</li>
                <li>Scrum retrospectives</li>
                <li>Sprint planning</li>
                <li>Escaped defects</li>
                <li>Defect density</li>
                <li>Sprint burndown</li>
                <li>Team velocity</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>37) What are the different phases of risk management?</h3>

            <p>Following are the five different phases of risk management:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Risk identification</li>
                <li>Risk categorization</li>
                <li>Risk response</li>
                <li>Risk review</li>
                <li>Risk closure</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>38) What does the &quot;Definition of Ready&quot; contains?</h3>

            <p>The &quot;Definition of Ready&quot; is a working agreement between the team and the Product Owner on what
                readiness means. The product backlog contains a list of items where the team can work, but it is
                essential to check if the things are in a ready state because it is necessary to be picked up in a
                sprint. First, the team has to specify what needs to be done and the amount of work required to complete
                the User Story or PBI. The Definition of Ready may differ from product to product or from team to team.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>39) What are the parameters to define the ready state for a User Story?</h3>

            <p>Following is the list of some parameters that can be used to define the Ready state for a User Story:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The PBI should be in the approved or equivalent state for the team to pick it up for development.
                </li>
                <li>The team should identify the User Story dependencies.</li>
                <li>Acceptance criteria should exist and be understood by the team.</li>
                <li>Acceptance criteria should have sufficient details on the features so that the team can develop and
                    test them.</li>
                <li>Performance criteria should have provided to the team to understand it well.</li>
                <li>The PBI should be written in the Actor-&gt;Action-&gt;Outcome format.</li>
                <li>The team should have an idea of what it will mean Demo the User Story.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>40) What does DoD mean? What is its usage?</h3>

            <p>DoD stands for &quot;Definition of Done.&quot; It specifies a collection of deliverables, including
                written codes, comments on coding, unit tests, integration testing, design documents, release notes,
                etc. It is formed by a list of tasks that define the work&#39;s quality. It is used to decide whether an
                activity from the Sprint backlog is completed.</p>

            <p>DoD is beneficial to scrum while identifying the deliverables to achieve the objective of the projects.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Following is the list of its essential usages:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>To define the steps required to deliver the iteration.</li>
                <li>To use appropriate tools such as burndown to make the process more effective.</li>
                <li>To ensure on-time feedback throughout the project life cycle.</li>
                <li>To ensure that the walkthrough of the product backlog items is done and understood correctly.</li>
                <li>To ensure that the DoD is defined to become task-oriented.</li>
                <li>To create the checklist for the product backlog items.</li>
                <li>To involve the product owner for reviewing during the Sprint and sprint retrospective.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>41) What do you understand by the term &quot;Servant Leader&quot;? How can a Scrum Master be a Servant
                Leader?</h3>

            <p>The term &quot;Servant Leader&quot; mainly specifies the service orientation which a leader should
                demonstrate. The Scrum Master should act as a facilitator, a guide, a mentor, etc. By using this
                technique, the team can increase involvement and empowerment.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>42) How can you coordinate between multiple teams?</h3>

            <p>There are many approaches to coordinate between multiple teams. One of the most common strategies for
                this is the Scrum of Scrums (SoS) meeting. In this meeting, the members representing each scrum team
                discuss the progress, performance, issues, risks, etc. The team should pre-define the frequency of these
                meetings. Generally, scrum masters would represent a particular scrum team, besides having the Chief
                Scrum Master (whose responsibility is coordination &amp; collaboration among all the scrums) who
                facilitates these meetings.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>43) How can a Scrum Master increase the productivity of the development team?</h3>

            <p>Scrum Masters can quickly increase the development team&#39;s productivity by facilitating their
                decisions and removing impediments. Scrum Master does not manage the development team. But the Scrum
                Master helps the team by promoting their choices and eliminating barriers, and protecting them from
                external distractions.</p>

            <h2>Top 20 Interview Questions for Java Technical Architect</h2>

            <h3>1) Explain the Architecture of Java J2EE?</h3>

            <p>J2EE is Java 2 Enterprise Edition that provides a convenient way for developing and implementing Java
                enterprise applications. The J2EE architecture is a three-tiered architecture, which are client, Middle,
                and enterprise data tier.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Client Tier</strong>&nbsp;is an interactive medium used to interact with the client or
                user. It consists of web clients and application clients.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Middle Tier</strong>&nbsp;defines the functioning units.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Data Tier</strong>&nbsp;is meant for storage purposes. It is used in the form of a
                relational database, containers, components, and services.</p>

            <p><img alt="Java Technical Architect Interview Questions"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/java-technical-architect-interview-questions-q1.jpg" />
            </p>

            <p>Specifically, the J2EE architecture consists of four tiers; the client, web, enterprise Java Bean, and
                enterprise information tier, but the middle tier holds two Web+ EJB tiers.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>2) What is the ETL process?</h3>

            <p>ETL stands for Extract, Transfer, and Load. It is a process to extract data from multiple resources, then
                transfer it by performing the operations such as concatenations, calculations, etc., and load it into a
                data warehouse system.</p>

            <p>In this process, we need active inputs from various stakeholders such as developers, analysts, testers,
                etc. It is a technically challenging process.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>3) What is Functional Programming in Java?</h3>

            <p>Java supports functional programming. Since Java 8, we can use Lambda expression for functional
                programming. We can also use code to declare the functional paradigm.</p>

            <p>Functional programming is a programming approach in which computations can be coded as functions. These
                functions are mathematical functions called the lambda function.</p>

            <p>The functional programming is declarative, which means we do not need to describe the control flow of a
                computation logic.</p>

            <p>The below program implements the functional programming in Java using a lambda expression:</p>

            <p><strong>Test.java:</strong></p>

            <p>In the above program, we have achieved the functional programming using Java 8. we can also do the same
                by using the anonymous method.</p>

            <p>We have evaluated a function and assigned it to a runnable interface. Now, this function has been treated
                as a first-class citizen. So this is the basic concept of functional programming.</p>

            <h3>4) Explain the difference between JDBC and Hibernate</h3>

            <p>The JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity) is a programming interface that creates a connection between Java
                application and database. It establishes a link between the Java program and database so that we can
                send the data from the Java code and store it in our database.</p>

            <p>Hibernate is an open-source ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework. It allows us to develop the
                objects which are independent of the database tool and creates independent persistence logic. Basically,
                It simplifies the interaction process between Java applications and databases. It implements JPA(Java
                Persistence API).</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>5) Explain The Hibernate Architecture</h3>

            <p>The Hibernate architecture consists of the following four layers:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Application layer</li>
                <li>Framework layer</li>
                <li>Backhand api layer</li>
                <li>Database layer</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>6) What are some essential elements of Hibernate Architecture?</h3>

            <p>The following are the elements of Hibernate Architecture:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>SessionFactory</li>
                <li>Session</li>
                <li>Transaction</li>
                <li>ConnectionProvider</li>
                <li>TransactionFactory</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>SessionFactory</strong></p>

            <p>The SessionFactory holds the session objects. It contains the second-level data cache( optional). It uses
                the org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface to provide a factory method to access the session object.</p>

            <p><strong>Session</strong></p>

            <p>The session object acts as a medium between the application and database. It provides an interface to the
                application to access the stored data from the database.</p>

            <p>The session object is a short-lived object and encloses the JDBC connection. It is a factory of the
                different elements of the session such as Query, transaction, criteria. It holds the first-level data
                cache (mandatory).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The org.hibernate.Session interface provides methods to insert, update and delete the object.
                Furthermore, it provides factory methods for Transaction, Query, and Criteria.</p>

            <p><strong>Transaction</strong></p>

            <p>The transaction objects contain the atomic unit of the tasks. It is an optional element. The
                org.hibernate.Transaction interface provides methods for transaction management.</p>

            <p><strong>ConnectionProvider</strong></p>

            <p>The ConnectionProvider provides JDBC connections. It is an optional element. It abstracts the application
                from DriverManager or DataSource.</p>

            <p><strong>TransactionFactory</strong></p>

            <p>The TransactionFactory is an optional element. It holds the transaction objects.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>7) If a Database Deadlock occurs, then how would you deal with it?</h3>

            <p>The Deadlock is a situation when multiple requests are tried to acquire its lock. To prevent the database
                from going into this state, we will make a queue to verify each request before forwarding it to the
                database.</p>

            <p>Besides the above mention strategy, we can also follow the below strategies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We can avoid the database deadlock by using fewer cursors to avoid locking the tables.</li>
                <li>By using a small transaction</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>8) What would be better to store session info or using the session info in the request?</h3>

            <p>To store the session info would be better than using the session info in the request. Because using the
                session info in the request can be intercepted and vulnerable. A cookie can be accessed by the
                respective domain only and ensures that the right session information is passed by the user.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>9) Differentiate the first level and second level cache in Hibernate</h3>

            <p>The first level cache is maintained at the session level and can be accessed only to the session.
                Comparatively, the second-level cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and available for all
                the sessions.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) How to Avoid the Lazyinitializationexception?</h3>

            <p>Follow the below steps to avoid the Lazyinitializationexception in Java:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Set lazy=false in the hibernate config file.</li>
                <li>Set @Basic(fetch=FetchType.EAGER) at the mapping.</li>
                <li>Ensure to access the dependent objects before closing the session.</li>
                <li>Using Fetch Join in HQL.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>11) What is LambdaExpression in Java?</h3>

            <p>Java supports LambdaExpression since Java 8. It is a type of short block code which takes in parameters
                and returns a value. Lambda expressions are much similar to methods; the difference between methods and
                Lambda Expression is that we do not need to write its name; instead, we can implement them right in a
                method&#39;s body.</p>

            <p>The basic syntaxes for the lambda expression are as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>parameter&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;expression&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>(parameter1,&nbsp;parameter2)&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;expression&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) Explain the Advantages of Using the Lambda Expressions</h3>

            <p>The following are some key advantages of using the lambda expression:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It Reduces the lines of code; by writing the Lambda expressions, we can perform the tasks by writing
                    fewer lines of code compared to ambiguous methods.</li>
                <li>It increases the readability.</li>
                <li>It eliminates shadow variables.</li>
                <li>It provides functional programming.</li>
                <li>It increases the code reusability.</li>
                <li>T provides enhanced iterative syntax.</li>
                <li>It provides simplified variable scope.</li>
                <li>It allows JAR file size reductions.</li>
                <li>It supports Parallel processing opportunities.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>13) What are the Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)?</h3>

            <p>The RPC or remote procedure calls are the interprocess communication technique that is used in
                client-based web applications. They are also known as subroutine calls or function calls.</p>

            <p>When a client made a request, RPC translates it and sends it to the server. Usually, these requests are
                function calls or a procedure to the remote server. When the server gets a request, it responds back to
                the client; the client is blocked during this process, only resumed when the server completes its
                execution.</p>

            <h3>14) What are the benefits of using Spring Framework in Java?</h3>

            <p>Spring is a powerful Java framework for developing enterprise Java applications. The following are some
                key benefits of using the Spring framework:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It provides support for managing the business objects and exposing their services.</li>
                <li>It supports an easy and optimized programming practice by using interfaces and predefined classes.
                </li>
                <li>It provides support for the POJO and POJI model programming.</li>
                <li>It is modular, which means we can choose an individual part of the project to work on.</li>
                <li>It facilitates both XML- and annotation-based configuration.</li>
                <li>It supports a lightweight container that can be activated easily.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>15) What is Database Sharding?</h3>

            <p>Sharding is a process to make the partition the data in database or search engine. In this process, the
                data is divided into small chunks or shards. The shard can be a table. Postgres schema or a database
                held on a database server instance.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>16) What are the web services?</h3>

            <p>The Web Services are the client and server applications that communicate over the internet using the HTTP
                protocol. They provide a convenient mechanism to interoperate between software applications and
                frameworks.</p>

            <p>We can also understand web services as methods of communication between two devices.</p>

            <h3>17) Explain the difference between SOAP Services and Rest Services?</h3>

            <p>SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol while Rest stands for</p>

            <p>Representational State Transfer.</p>

            <p>The SOAP is a protocol that was designed before the idea of the Rest; it is mainly used to ensure that
                the programs can easily transfer the data over different platforms and programming languages.</p>

            <p>Comparatively, Rest is designed for working with media components, files, and objects on a particular
                device. The services which are designed using the REST principles are called RestFul web services.</p>

            <h3>18) Why Web services use HTTP as the communication protocol?</h3>

            <p>HTTP is the most preferred way of communicating over the web. Nowadays, most applications are designed in
                a way to communicate through the HTTP protocol. So using web services with the HTTP makes applications
                accessible from a wide variety of applications.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>19) What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPs?</h3>

            <p>The HTTPs is the extended version of the HTTP protocol. The major difference between HTTP and HTTPs is
                the SSL certificate. The HTTPs provides additional security to the application. The HTTPs becomes very
                useful for those web applications that keep the sensitive information of the user, such as credit card
                details.</p>

            <h3>20) Explain the working of TCP/IP.</h3>

            <p>The TCP/IP model was developed to provide efficient and accurate data transmission between devices. It
                breaks a message into several small packets to avoid transmission failure in a long size file. In case
                it encounters a problem during the transmission, it will start sending the packets again from where they
                break and reassembles the packets at the destination port. Every route can take a different route to
                reach the destination. Thus, it provides a secure and uninterrupted data transmission.</p>
