            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions.PNG" /></p>

            <p>The following are the most popular and useful SQL interview questions and answers for fresher and
                experienced candidates. These questions are created specifically to familiarise you with the types of
                questions you might encounter during your SQL interview. According to our experiences, good interviewers
                rarely plan to ask any specific topic during the interview. Instead, questioning usually begins with a
                basic understanding of the subject, and based on your responses, further discussion happened.</p>

            <h3>1) What is SQL?</h3>

            <p>SQL stands for the Structured Query Language. It is the standard language used to maintain the relational
                database and perform many different data manipulation operations on the data. SQL was initially invented
                in 1970. It is a database language used for database creation, deletion, fetching and modifying rows,
                etc. sometimes, it is pronounced as &#39;sequel.&#39; We can also use it to handle organized data
                comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>2) When SQL appeared?</h3>

            <p>SQL first appeared in 1974. It is one of the most used languages for maintaining the relational database.
                In 1986, SQL became the standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and ISO
                (International Organization for Standardization) in 1987.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>3) What are the usages of SQL?</h3>

            <p>SQL is responsible for maintaining the relational data and the data structures present in the database.
                Some of the common usages are given below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To execute queries against a database</li>
                <li>To retrieve data from a database</li>
                <li>To inserts records in a database</li>
                <li>To updates records in a database</li>
                <li>To delete records from a database</li>
                <li>To create new databases</li>
                <li>To create new tables in a database</li>
                <li>To create views in a database</li>
                <li>To perform complex operations on the database.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>4) Does SQL support programming language features?</h3>

            <p>SQL refers to the Standard Query Language. Therefore, it is true that SQL is a language but does not
                actually support the programming language. It is a common language that doesn&#39;t have a loop,
                conditional statements, and logical operations. It cannot be used for anything other than data
                manipulation. It is a command language to perform database operations. The primary purpose of SQL is to
                retrieve, manipulate, update, delete, and perform complex operations like joins on the data present in
                the database.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>5) What are the subsets of SQL?</h3>

            <p>The following are the four significant subsets of the SQL:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data definition language (DDL):</strong>&nbsp;It defines the data structure that consists of
                    commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Data manipulation language (DML):</strong>&nbsp;It is used to manipulate existing data in
                    the database. The commands in this category are SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Data control language (DCL):</strong>&nbsp;It controls access to the data stored in the
                    database. The commands in this category include GRANT and REVOKE.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Control Language (TCL):</strong>&nbsp;It is used to deal with the transaction
                    operations in the database. The commands in this category are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SET TRANSACTION,
                    SAVEPOINT, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>6) What is the purpose of DDL Language?</h3>

            <p>DDL stands for Data definition language. It is the subset of a database that defines the data structure
                of the database when the database is created.&nbsp;<strong>For example,</strong>&nbsp;we can use the DDL
                commands to add, remove, or modify tables. It consists of the following commands: CREATE, ALTER and
                DELETE database objects such as schema, tables, indexes, view, sequence, etc.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;Students&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>(&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Roll_no&nbsp;INT,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Name&nbsp;VARCHAR(45),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Branch&nbsp;VARCHAR(30),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>7) What is the purpose of DML Language?</h3>

            <p>Data manipulation language makes the user able to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database.
                The DML commands can only perform read-only operations on data. We can perform the following operations
                using DDL language:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Insert data into the database through the INSERT command.</li>
                <li>Retrieve data from the database through the SELECT command.</li>
                <li>Update data in the database through the UPDATE command.</li>
                <li>Delete data from the database through the DELETE command.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;Student&nbsp;VALUES&nbsp;(111,&nbsp;&#39;George&#39;,&nbsp;&#39;Computer&nbsp;Science&#39;)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>8) What is the purpose of DCL Language?</h3>

            <p>Data control language allows users to control access and permission management to the database. It is the
                subset of a database, which decides that what part of the database should be accessed by which user at
                what point of time. It includes two commands, GRANT and REVOKE.</p>

            <p><strong>GRANT:</strong>&nbsp;It enables system administrators to assign privileges and roles to the
                specific user accounts to perform specific tasks on the database.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>REVOKE:</strong>&nbsp;It enables system administrators to revoke privileges and roles from the
                user accounts so that they cannot use the previously assigned permission on the database.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>GRANT&nbsp;*&nbsp;ON&nbsp;mydb.Student&nbsp;TO&nbsp;javatpoint@localhsot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>9) What are tables and fields in the database?</h3>

            <p>A table is a set of organized data in the form of rows and columns. It enables users to store and display
                records in the structure format. It is similar to worksheets in the spreadsheet application. Here rows
                refer to the tuples, representing the simple data item, and columns are the attribute of the data items
                present in a particular row. Columns can categorize as vertical, and Rows are horizontal.</p>

            <p>Fields are the components to provide the structure for the table. It stores the same category of data in
                the same data type. A table contains a fixed number of columns but can have any number of rows known as
                the record. It is also called a column in the table of the database. It represents the attribute or
                characteristics of the entity in the record.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Table:</strong>&nbsp;Student</p>

            <p><strong>Field:</strong>&nbsp;Stud_rollno, Stud_name, Date of Birth, Branch, etc.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) What is a primary key?</h3>

            <p>A primary key is a field or the combination of fields that uniquely identify each record in the table. It
                is one of a special kind of unique key. If the column contains a primary key, it cannot be null or
                empty. A table can have duplicate columns, but it cannot have more than one primary key. It always
                stores unique values into a column.&nbsp;<strong>For example,</strong>&nbsp;the ROLL Number can be
                treated as the primary key for a student in the university or college.</p>

                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions1.png" /></p>

            <p>We can define a primary key into a student table as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;Student&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roll_number&nbsp;INT&nbsp;PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name&nbsp;VARCHAR(45),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>11) What is a foreign key?</h3>

            <p>The foreign key is used to link one or more tables together. It is also known as the referencing key. A
                foreign key is specified as a key that is related to the primary key of another table. It means a
                foreign key field in one table refers to the primary key field of the other table. It identifies each
                row of another table uniquely that maintains the referential integrity. The primary key-foreign key
                relationship is a very crucial relationship as it maintains the ACID properties of the database
                sometimes. It also prevents actions that would destroy links between the child and parent tables.</p>

            <p>We can define a foreign key into a table as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CONSTRAINT&nbsp;constraint_name]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOREIGN&nbsp;KEY&nbsp;[foreign_key_name]&nbsp;(col_name,&nbsp;...)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REFERENCES&nbsp;parent_tbl_name&nbsp;(col_name,...)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) What is a unique key?</h3>

            <p>A unique key is a single or combination of fields that ensure all values stores in the column will be
                unique. It means a column cannot stores duplicate values. This key provides uniqueness for the column or
                set of columns.&nbsp;<strong>For example,</strong>&nbsp;the email addresses and roll numbers of
                student&#39;s tables should be unique. It can accept a null value but only one null value per column. It
                ensures the integrity of the column or group of columns to store different values into a table.</p>

            <p>We can define a foreign key into a table as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;table_name(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;col1&nbsp;datatype,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;col2&nbsp;datatype&nbsp;UNIQUE,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>13) What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?</h3>

            <p>The primary key and unique key both are essential constraints of the SQL. The main difference among them
                is that the primary key identifies each record in the table. In contrast, the unique key prevents
                duplicate entries in a column except for a NULL value. The following comparison chart explains it more
                clearly:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Primary Key</th>
                        <th>Unique Key</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The primary key act as a unique identifier for each record in the table.</td>
                        <td>The unique key is also a unique identifier for records when the primary key is not present
                            in the table.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>We cannot store NULL values in the primary key column.</td>
                        <td>We can store NULL value in the unique key column, but only one NULL is allowed.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>We cannot change or delete the primary key column values.</td>
                        <td>We can modify the unique key column values.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>14) What is a Database?</h3>

            <p>A database is an organized collection of data that is structured into tables, rows, columns, and indexes.
                It helps the user to find the relevant information frequently. It is an electronic system that makes
                data access, data manipulation, data retrieval, data storing, and data management very easy. Almost
                every organization uses the database for storing the data due to its easily accessible and high
                operational ease. The database provides perfect access to data and lets us perform required tasks.</p>

            <p>The following are the common features of a database:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Manages large amounts of data</li>
                <li>Accurate</li>
                <li>Easy to update</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Data integrity</li>
                <li>Easy to research data</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>15) What is meant by DBMS?</h3>

            <p>DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software program that primarily functions as an
                interface between the database and the end-user. It provides us the power such as managing the data, the
                database engine, and the database schema to facilitate the organization and manipulation of data using a
                simple query in almost no time. It is like a File Manager that manages data in a database rather than
                saving it in file systems. Without the database management system, it would be far more difficult for
                the user to access the database&#39;s data.</p>

            <p>The following are the components of a DBMS:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Software</li>
                <li>Data</li>
                <li>Procedures</li>
                <li>Database Languages</li>
                <li>Query Processor</li>
                <li>Database Manager</li>
                <li>Database Engine</li>
                <li>Reporting</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>16) What are the different types of database management systems?</h3>

            <p>The database management systems can be categorized into several types. Some of the important lists are
                given below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hierarchical databases (DBMS)</li>
                <li>Network databases (IDMS)</li>
                <li>Relational databases (RDBMS</li>
                <li>Object-oriented databases</li>
                <li>Document databases (Document DB)</li>
                <li>Graph databases</li>
                <li>ER model databases</li>
                <li>NoSQL databases</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>17) What is RDBMS?</h3>

            <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a database management system based on a
                relational model. It facilitates you to manipulate the data stored in the tables by using relational
                operators. RDBMS stores the data into the collection of tables and links those tables using the
                relational operators easily whenever required. Examples of relational database management systems are
                Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle database, etc.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>18) What is Normalization in a Database?</h3>

            <p>Normalization is used to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database.
            </p>

            <p>There are some rules of database normalization, which is commonly known as Normal From, and they are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First normal form(1NF)</li>
                <li>Second normal form(2NF)</li>
                <li>Third normal form(3NF)</li>
                <li>Boyce-Codd normal form(BCNF)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Using these steps, the redundancy, anomalies, inconsistency of the data in the database can be removed.
            </p>

            <h3>19) What is the primary use of Normalization?</h3>

            <p>Normalization is mainly used to add, delete or modify a field that can be made in a single table. The
                primary use of Normalization is to remove redundancy and remove the insert, delete and update
                distractions. Normalization breaks the table into small partitions and then links them using different
                relationships to avoid the chances of redundancy.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>20) What are the disadvantages of not performing database Normalization?</h3>

            <p>The major disadvantages are:</p>

            <p>The occurrence of redundant terms in the database causes the waste of space in the disk.</p>

            <p>Due to redundant terms, inconsistency may also occur. If any change is made in the data of one table but
                not made in the same data of another table, then inconsistency will occur. This inconsistency will lead
                to the maintenance problem and effects the ACID properties as well.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>21) What is an inconsistent dependency?</h3>

            <p>An Inconsistent dependency refers to the difficulty of getting relevant data due to a missing or broken
                path to the data. It leads users to search the data in the wrong table, resulting in an error as an
                output.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>22) What is Denormalization in a Database?</h3>

            <p>Denormalization is a technique used by database administrators to optimize the efficiency of their
                database infrastructure. The denormalization concept is based on Normalization, which is defined as
                arranging a database into tables correctly for a particular purpose. This method allows us to add
                redundant data into a normalized database to alleviate issues with database queries that merge data from
                several tables into a single table. It adds redundant terms into the tables to avoid complex joins and
                many other complex operations.</p>

            <p>Denormalization doesn&#39;t mean that normalization will not be done. It is an optimization strategy that
                takes place after the normalization process.</p>

            <h3>23) What are the different types of SQL operators?</h3>

            <p>Operators are the special keywords or special characters reserved for performing particular operations.
                They are also used in SQL queries. We can primarily use these operators within the WHERE clause of SQL
                commands. It&#39;s a part of the command to filters data based on the specified condition. The SQL
                operators can be categorized into the following types:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic operators:</strong>&nbsp;These operators are used to perform mathematical
                    operations on numerical data. The categories of this operators are addition (+), subtraction (-),
                    multiplication (*), division (/), remainder/modulus (%), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical operators:</strong>&nbsp;These operators evaluate the expressions and return their
                    results in True or False. This operator includes ALL, AND, ANY, ISNULL, EXISTS, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE,
                    NOT, OR, UNIQUE.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison operators:</strong>&nbsp;These operators are used to perform comparisons of two
                    values and check whether they are the same or not. It includes equal to (=), not equal to (!= or
                    &lt;&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than (&gt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=), greater than or
                    equal to (&gt;=), not less than (!&lt;), not greater than (!&gt;), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Bitwise operators:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to do bit manipulations between two expressions
                    of integer type. It first performs conversion of integers into binary bits and then applied
                    operators such as AND (&amp; symbol), OR (|, ^), NOT (~), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Compound operators:</strong>&nbsp;These operators perform operations on a variable before
                    setting the variable&#39;s result to the operation&#39;s result. It includes Add equals (+=),
                    subtract equals (-=), multiply equals (*=), divide equals (/=), modulo equals (%=), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>String operators:</strong>&nbsp;These operators are primarily used to perform concatenation
                    and pattern matching of strings. It includes + (String concatenation), += (String concatenation
                    assignment), % (Wildcard), [] (Character(s) matches), [^] (Character(s) not to match), _ (Wildcard
                    match one character), etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>24) What is a view in SQL?</h3>

            <p>A view is a database object that has no values. It is a virtual table that contains a subset of data
                within a table. It looks like an actual table containing rows and columns, but it takes less space
                because it is not present physically. It is operated similarly to the base table but does not contain
                any data of its own. Its name is always unique. A view can have data from one or more tables. If any
                changes occur in the underlying table, the same changes reflected in the views also.</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions2.png" /></p>

            <p>The primary use of a view is to implement the security mechanism. It is the searchable object where we
                can use a query to search the view as we use for the table. It only shows the data returned by the query
                that was declared when the view was created.</p>

            <p>We can create a view by using the following syntax:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;VIEW&nbsp;view_name&nbsp;AS&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;column_lists&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table_name&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>WHERE&nbsp;condition;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>25) What is an Index in SQL?</h3>

            <p>An index is a disc structure associated with a table or view that speeds up row retrieval. It reduces the
                cost of the query because the query&#39;s high cost will lead to a fall in its performance. It is used
                to increase the performance and allow faster retrieval of records from the table. Indexing reduces the
                number of data pages we need to visit to find a particular data page. It also has a unique value meaning
                that the index cannot be duplicated. An index creates an entry for each value which makes it faster to
                retrieve data.</p>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong>&nbsp;Suppose we have a book which carries the details of the countries. If
                you want to find out information about India, why will you go through every page of that book? You could
                directly go to the index. Then from the index, you can go to that particular page where all the
                information about India is given.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>26) What are the different types of indexes in SQL?</h3>

            <p>SQL indexes are nothing more than a technique of minimizing the query&#39;s cost. The higher the
                query&#39;s cost, the worse the query&#39;s performance. The following are the different types of
                Indexes supported in SQL:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Unique Index</li>
                <li>Clustered Index</li>
                <li>Non-Clustered Index</li>
                <li>Bit-Map Index</li>
                <li>Normal Index</li>
                <li>Composite Index</li>
                <li>B-Tree Index</li>
                <li>Function-Based Index</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>27) What is the unique index?</h3>

            <p>UNIQUE INDEX is used to enforce the uniqueness of values in single or multiple columns. We can create
                more than one unique index in a single table. For creating a unique index, the user has to check the
                data in the column because the unique indexes are used when any column of the table has unique values.
                This indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. A
                unique index can be applied automatically when a primary key is defined.</p>

            <p>We can create it by using the following syntax:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;UNIQUE&nbsp;INDEX&nbsp;index_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>ON&nbsp;table_name&nbsp;(index_column1,&nbsp;index_column2,...);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;Employee(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ID&nbsp;int&nbsp;AUTO_INCREMENT&nbsp;PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name&nbsp;varchar(45),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;varchar(15),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City&nbsp;varchar(25),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Suppose we want to make a Phone column as a unique index. We can do this like below:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;UNIQUE&nbsp;INDEX&nbsp;index_name_phone&nbsp;ON&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;(Phone);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>

            <h3>28) What is clustered index in SQL?</h3>

            <p>A clustered index is actually a table where the data for the rows are stored. It determines the order of
                the table data based on the key values that can sort in only one direction. Each table can have only one
                clustered index. It is the only index, which has been automatically created when the primary key is
                generated. If many data modifications needed to be done in the table, then clustered indexes are
                preferred.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>29) What is the non-clustered index in SQL?</h3>

            <p>The indexes other than PRIMARY indexes (clustered indexes) are called non-clustered indexes. We know that
                clustered indexes are created automatically when primary keys are generated, and non-clustered indexes
                are created when multiple joins conditions and various filters are used in the query. The non-clustered
                index and table data are both stored in different places. It cannot be able to alter the physical order
                of the table and maintains the logical order of data.</p>

            <p>The purpose of creating a non-clustered index is for searching the data. Its best example is a book where
                the content is written in one place, and the index is at a different place. We can create 0 to 249
                non-clustered indexes in each table. The non-clustered indexing improves the performance of the queries
                which use keys without assigning the primary key.</p>

            <h3>35) Which are joins in SQL? Name the most commonly used SQL joins?</h3>

            <p>SQL joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables into a meaningful result set. It is performed
                whenever you need to fetch records from two or more tables. They are used with SELECT statement and join
                conditions.</p>

            <p>The following are the most commonly used joins in SQL:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>INNER JOIN</li>
                <li>LEFT OUTER JOIN</li>

            <h3>36) What are the different types of joins in SQL?</h3>

            <p>Joins are used to merge two tables or retrieve data from tables. It depends on the relationship between
                tables. According to the ANSI standard, the following are the different types of joins used in SQL:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>INNER JOIN</li>
                <li>SELF JOIN</li>

            <h3>37) What is INNER JOIN in SQL?</h3>

            <p>Inner join returns only those records from the tables that match the specified condition and hides other
                rows and columns. In simple words, it fetches rows when there is at least one match of rows between the
                tables is found. INNER JOIN keyword joins the matching records from two tables. It is assumed as a
                default join, so it is optional to use the INNER keyword with the query.</p>

            <h3>38) What is the Right JOIN in SQL?</h3>

            <p>The Right join is used to retrieve all rows from the right-hand table and only those rows from the other
                table that fulfilled the join condition. It returns all the rows from the right-hand side table even
                though there are no matches in the left-hand side table. If it finds unmatched records from the left
                side table, it returns a Null value. This join is also known as Right Outer Join.</p>

            <h3>39) What is Left Join in SQL?</h3>

            <p>The Left Join is used to fetch all rows from the left-hand table and common records between the specified
                tables. It returns all the rows from the left-hand side table even though there are no matches on the
                right-hand side table. If it will not find any matching record from the right side table, then it
                returns null. This join can also be called a Left Outer Join.</p>

            <p>The Full Join results from a combination of both left and right join that contains all the records from
                both tables. It fetches rows when there are matching rows in any one of the tables. This means it
                returns all the rows from the left-hand side table and all the rows from the right-hand side tables. If
                a match is not found, it puts NULL value. It is also known as FULL OUTER JOIN.</p>

            <h3>41) What is a &quot;TRIGGER&quot; in SQL?</h3>

            <p>A trigger is a set of SQL statements that reside in a system catalog. It is a special type of stored
                procedure that is invoked automatically in response to an event. It allows us to execute a batch of code
                when an insert, update or delete command is run against a specific table because the trigger is the set
                of activated actions whenever DML commands are given to the system.</p>

            <p>SQL triggers have two main components one is action, and another is an event. When certain actions are
                taken, an event occurs as a result of those actions.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We use the CREATE TRIGGER statement for creating a trigger in SQL. Here is the syntax:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TRIGGER&nbsp;trigger_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <h3>42) What is self-join and what is the requirement of self-join?</h3>

            <p>A SELF JOIN is used to join a table with itself. This join can be performed using table aliases, which
                allow us to avoid repeating the same table name in a single sentence. It will throw an error if we use
                the same table name more than once in a single query without using table aliases.</p>

            <p>A SELF JOIN is required when we want to combine data with other data in the same table itself. It is
                often very useful to convert a hierarchical structure to a flat structure.</p>

            <p>The following syntax illustrates the SELF JOIN:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;column_lists&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>FROM&nbsp;table1&nbsp;AS&nbsp;T1,&nbsp;table1&nbsp;AS&nbsp;T2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>WHERE&nbsp;join_conditions;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <p>Suppose we have a table &#39;Student&#39; having the following data:</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions8.png" /></p>

            <p>If we want to get retrieve the student_id and name from the table where student_id is equal, and
                course_id is not equal, it can be done by using the self-join:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;&nbsp;s1.student_id,&nbsp;s1.name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>FROM&nbsp;student&nbsp;AS&nbsp;s1,&nbsp;student&nbsp;s2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>WHERE&nbsp;s1.student_id=s2.student_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>AND&nbsp;s1.course_id&lt;&gt;s2.course_id;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here is the result:</p>

            <h3>43) What are the set operators in SQL?</h3>

            <p>We use the set operators to merge data from one or more tables of the same kind. Although the set
                operators are like SQL joins, there is a significant distinction. SQL joins combine columns from
                separate tables, whereas SQL set operators combine rows from different queries. SQL queries that contain
                set operations are called compound queries. The set operators in SQL are categories into four different
                types:</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions10.jpg" /></p>

            <p><strong>A. UNION:</strong>&nbsp;It combines two or more results from multiple SELECT queries into a
                single result set. It has a default feature to remove the duplicate rows from the tables. The following
                syntax illustrates the Union operator:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>UNION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>B. UNION ALL:</strong>&nbsp;This operator is similar to the Union operator, but it does not
                remove the duplicate rows from the output of the SELECT statements. The following syntax illustrates the
                UNION ALL operator:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>UNION&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>C. INTERSECT:</strong>&nbsp;This operator returns the common records from two or more SELECT
                statements. It always retrieves unique records and arranges them in ascending order by default. Here,
                the number of columns and data types should be the same. The following syntax illustrates the INTERSECT
                operator:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>INTERSECT&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>D. MINUS:</strong>&nbsp;This operator returns the records from the first query, which is not
                found in the second query. It does not return duplicate values. The following syntax illustrates the
                MINUS operator:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>MINUS&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;columns&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <h3>45) What is a constraint? Tell me about its various levels.</h3>

            <p>The constraint is used to specify the rule and regulations that allows or restricts what values/data will
                be stored in the table. It ensures data accuracy and integrity inside the table. It enforces us to store
                valid data and prevents us from storing irrelevant data. If any interruption occurs between the
                constraint and data action, the action is failed. Some of the most commonly used constraints are NOT
                NULL, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE KEY, etc.</p>

            <p>The following syntax illustrates us to create a constraint for a table:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;table_name&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column1&nbsp;datatype&nbsp;constraint,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column2&nbsp;datatype&nbsp;constraint,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>SQL categories the constraints into two levels:</p>

            <p><strong>Column Level Constraints:</strong>&nbsp;These constraints are only applied to a single column and
                limit the type of data that can be stored in that column.</p>

            <p><strong>Table Level Constraints:</strong>&nbsp;These constraints are applied to the entire table and
                limit the type of data that can be entered.</p>

            <h3>49) What is the ACID property in a database?</h3>

            <p>The ACID properties are meant for the transaction that goes through a different group of tasks. A
                transaction is a single logical order of data. It provides properties to maintain consistency before and
                after the transaction in a database. It also ensures that the data transactions are processed reliably
                in a database system.</p>

            <p>The ACID property is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>

            <p><strong>Atomicity:</strong>&nbsp;It ensures that all statements or operations within the transaction unit
                must be executed successfully. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and
                the database state is left unchanged. Its main features are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and AUTO-COMMIT.</p>

            <p><strong>Consistency:</strong>&nbsp;This property ensures that the data must meet all validation rules. In
                simple words, we can say that the database changes state only when a transaction will be committed
                successfully. It also protects data from crashes.</p>

            <p><strong>Isolation:</strong>&nbsp;This property guarantees that the concurrent property of execution in
                the transaction unit must be operated independently. It also ensures that statements are transparent to
                each other. The main goal of providing isolation is to control concurrency in a database.</p>

            <p><strong>Durability:</strong>&nbsp;This property guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it
                persists permanently even if the system crashes, power loss, or failed.</p>

            <h3>50) Is a blank space or zero the same as a NULL value?</h3>

            <p>No. The NULL value is not the same as zero or a blank space. The following points explain their main
                differences:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A NULL value is a value, which is &#39;unavailable, unassigned, unknown or not applicable.&#39; It
                    would be used in the absence of any value. We can perform arithmetic operations on it. On the other
                    hand, zero is a number, and a blank space is treated as a character.</li>
                <li>The NULL value can be treated as an unknown and missing value, but zero and blank spaces differ from
                    the NULL value.</li>
                <li>We can compare a blank space or a zero to another blank space or a zero. On the other hand, one NULL
                    may not be the same as another NULL. NULL indicates that no data has been provided or that no data
                    exists.</li>

            <h3>51) What are functions and their usage in SQL?</h3>

            <p>SQL functions are simple code snippets that are frequently used and re-used in database systems for data
                processing and manipulation. Functions are the measured values. It always performs a specific task. The
                following rules should be remembered while creating functions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A function should have a name, and the name cannot begin with a special character such as @, $, #,
                    or other similar characters.</li>
                <li>Functions can only work with the SELECT statements.</li>
                <li>Every time a function is called, it compiles.</li>
                <li>Functions must return value or result.</li>
                <li>Functions are always used with input parameters.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SQL categories the functions into two types:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Defined Function:</strong>&nbsp;Functions created by a user based on their needs are
                    termed user-defined functions.</li>
                <li><strong>System Defined Function:</strong>&nbsp;Functions whose definition is defined by the system
                    are termed system-defined functions. They are built-in database functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SQL functions are used for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To perform calculations on data</li>
                <li>To modify individual data items</li>
                <li>To manipulate the output</li>
                <li>To format dates and numbers</li>
                <li>To convert data types</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>52) What is meant by case manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.</h3>

            <p>Case manipulation functions are part of the character functions. It converts the data from the state in
                which it is already stored in the table to upper, lower, or mixed case. The conversion performed by this
                function can be used to format the output. We can use it in almost every part of the SQL statement. Case
                manipulation functions are mostly used when you need to search for data, and you don&#39;t have any idea
                that the data you are looking for is in lower case or upper case.</p>

            <p>There are three case manipulation functions in SQL:</p>

            <p><strong>LOWER:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to converts a given character into lowercase. The
                following example will return the &#39;STEPHEN&#39; as &#39;stephen&#39;:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;LOWER&nbsp;(&#39;STEPHEN&#39;)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Case_Reault&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;dual;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>NOTE: Here, &#39;dual&#39; is a dummy table.</h4>

            <p><strong>UPPER:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to converts a given character into uppercase. The
                following example will return the &#39;stephen&#39; as &#39;STEPHEN&#39;:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;UPPER&nbsp;(&#39;stephen&#39;)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Case_Reault&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;dual;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>INITCAP:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to converts given character values to uppercase for
                the initials of each word. It means every first letter of the word is converted into uppercase, and the
                rest is in lower case. The following example will return the &#39;hello stephen&#39; as &#39;Hello
                Stephen&#39;:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;INITCAP&nbsp;(&#39;hello&nbsp;stephen&#39;)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Case_Reault&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;dual;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>53) Explain character-manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.</h3>

            <p>Character-manipulation functions are used to change, extract, and alter the character string. When one or
                more characters and words are passed into the function, the function will perform its operation on those
                input strings and return the result.</p>

            <p>The following are the character manipulation functions in SQL:</p>

            <p><strong>A) CONCAT:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to join two or more values together. It always
                appends the second string into the end of the first string. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT CONCAT (&#39;Information-&#39;, &#39;technology&#39;) FROM DUAL;</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;Information-technology</p>

            <p><strong>B) SUBSTR:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to return the portion of the string from a specified start
                point to an endpoint. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT SUBSTR (&#39;Database Management System&#39;, 9, 11) FROM DUAL;</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;Management</p>

            <p><strong>C) LENGTH:</strong>&nbsp;This function returns the string&#39;s length in numerical value,
                including the blank spaces. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT LENGTH (&#39;Hello Javatpoint&#39;) FROM DUAL;</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;16</p>

            <p><strong>D) INSTR:</strong>&nbsp;This function finds the exact numeric position of a specified character
                or word in a given string. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT INSTR (&#39;Hello Javatpoint&#39;, &#39;Javatpoint&#39;);</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;7</p>

            <p><strong>E) LPAD:</strong>&nbsp;It returns the padding of the left-side character value for
                right-justified value. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT LPAD (&#39;200&#39;, 6,&#39;*&#39;);</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;***200</p>

            <p><strong>F) RPAD:</strong>&nbsp;It returns the padding of the right-side character value for
                left-justified value. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT RPAD (&#39;200&#39;, 6,&#39;*&#39;);</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;200***</p>

            <p><strong>G) TRIM:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to remove all the defined characters from the
                beginning, end, or both. It also trimmed extra spaces. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT TRIM (&#39;A&#39; FROM &#39;ABCDCBA&#39;);</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;BCDCB</p>

            <p><strong>H) REPLACE:</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to replace all occurrences of a word or portion
                of the string (substring) with the other specified string value. For example:</p>

            <p><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;SELECT REPLACE ( &#39;It is the best coffee at the famous coffee shop.&#39;,
                &#39;coffee&#39;, &#39;tea&#39;);</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;It is the best tea at the famous tea shop.</p>

            <h3>54) What is the usage of the NVL() function?</h3>

            <p>The NVL() function is used to convert the NULL value to the other value. The function returns the value
                of the second parameter if the first parameter is NULL. If the first parameter is anything other than
                NULL, it is left unchanged. This function is used in Oracle, not in SQL and MySQL. Instead of NVL()
                function, MySQL have IFNULL() and SQL Server have ISNULL() function.</p>

            <p>The MOD function returns the remainder in a division operation.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>56) What are the syntax and use of the COALESCE function?</h3>

            <p>The COALESCE() function evaluates the arguments in sequence and returns the first NON-NULL value in a
                specified number of expressions. If it evaluates arguments as NULL or not found any NON-NULL value, it
                returns the NULL result.</p>

            <p>The syntax of COALESCE function is given below:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>COALESCE&nbsp;(exp1,&nbsp;exp2,&nbsp;....&nbsp;expn)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;COALESCE(NULL,&nbsp;&#39;Hello&#39;,&nbsp;&#39;Javatpoint&#39;,&nbsp;NULL)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Result;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>This statement will return the following output:</p>

            <h3>57) How do we use the DISTINCT statement? What is its use?</h3>

            <p>The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that the fetched value always has unique values. It does not allow
                to have duplicate values. The DISTINCT keyword is used with the SELECT statement and retrieves different
                values from the table&#39;s column. We can use it with the help of the following syntax:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;DISTINCT&nbsp;column_lists&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;table_name&nbsp;WHERE&nbsp;[condition];&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Suppose we have a table &#39;customer&#39; containing eight records in which the name column has some
                duplicate values.</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions14.png" /></p>

            <p>If we want to get the name column without any duplicate values, the DISTINCT keyword is required.
                Executing the below command will return a name column with unique values.</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"

            <h3>58) What is the default ordering of data using the ORDER BY clause? How could it be changed?</h3>

            <p>The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the table data either in ascending or descending order. By default,
                it will sort the table in ascending order. If we want to change its default behavior, we need to use the
                DESC keyword after the column name in the ORDER BY clause.</p>

            <p>The syntax to do this is given below:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;expressions&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;tables&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>WHERE&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>ORDER&nbsp;BY&nbsp;expression&nbsp;[ASC&nbsp;|&nbsp;DESC];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We have taken a customer table in the previous example. Now, we will demonstrate the ORDER BY clause on
                them as well.</p>

            <p>In the below output, we can see that the first query will sort the table data in ascending order based on
                the name column. However, if we run the second query by specifying the DESC keyword, the table&#39;s
                order is changed in descending order.</p>

            <p><img alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers"

            <h3>59) Is the following query returns the output?</h3>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;subject_code,&nbsp;AVG&nbsp;(marks)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>FROM&nbsp;Students&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>WHERE&nbsp;AVG(marks)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;70&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>GROUP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;subject_code;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;No. The above query does not return the output because we cannot use the
                WHERE clause to restrict the groups. We need to use the HAVING clause instead of the WHERE clause to get
                the correct output.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>60) What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses?</h3>

            <p>The main difference is that the WHERE clause is used to filter records before any groupings are
                established, whereas the HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group. The below comparison chart
                explains the most common differences:</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>WHERE</th>
                        <th>HAVING</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>This clause is implemented in row operations.</td>
                        <td>This clause is implemented in column operations.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>It does not allow to work with aggregate functions.</td>
                        <td>It can work with aggregate functions.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>This clause can be used with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.</td>
                        <td>This clause can only be used with the SELECT statement.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>61) How many Aggregate functions are available in SQL?</h3>

            <p>The aggregate function is used to determine and calculate several values in a table and return the result
                as a single number. For example, the average of all values, the sum of all values, and the maximum and
                minimum value among particular groupings of values.</p>

            <p>The following syntax illustrates how to use aggregate functions:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>function_name&nbsp;(DISTINCT&nbsp;|&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;expression)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>SQL provides seven (7) aggregate functions, which are given below:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>AVG():</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to returns the average value from specified
                    columns.</li>
                <li><strong>COUNT():</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to returns the number of table rows, including
                    rows with null values.</li>
                <li><strong>MAX():</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to returns the largest value among the group.
                </li>
                <li><strong>MIN():</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to returns the smallest value among the group.
                </li>
                <li><strong>SUM():</strong>&nbsp;This function is used to returns the total summed values(non-null) of
                    the specified column.</li>
                <li><strong>FIRST()</strong>: This function is used to returns the first value of an expression.</li>
                <li><strong>LAST()</strong>: This function is used to returns the last value of an expression.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>62) What is SQL Injection?</h3>

            <p>SQL injection is a type of vulnerability in website and web app code that allows attackers to control
                back-end operations and access, retrieve, and destroy sensitive data from databases. In this technique,
                malicious SQL statements are inserted into a database entry field, and once they are performed, the
                database becomes vulnerable to an attacker. This technique is commonly used to access sensitive data and
                perform administrative activities on databases by exploiting data-driven applications. It is also known
                as&nbsp;<strong>SQLi attack.</strong></p>

            <p>Some common examples of SQL injection are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Accessing confidential data to modify an SQL query to get desired results.</li>
                <li>UNION attacks to steal data from different database tables.</li>
                <li>Examine the database to extract information regarding the version and structure of the database.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>63) What is the difference between the RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions?</h3>

            <p>The&nbsp;<strong>RANK function</strong>&nbsp;determines the rank for each row within your ordered
                partition in the result set. If the two rows are assigned the same rank, then the next number in the
                ranking will be its previous rank plus a number of duplicate numbers. For example, if we have three
                records at rank 4, the next rank listed would be ranked 7.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<strong>DENSE_RANK</strong>&nbsp;function assigns a unique rank for each row within a partition
                as per the specified column value without any gaps. It always specifies ranking in consecutive order. If
                the two rows are assigned the same rank, this function will assign it with the same rank, and the next
                rank being the next sequential number. For example, if we have 3 records at rank 4, the next rank listed
                would be ranked 5.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>64) Is it possible to implicitly insert a row for the identity column?</h3>

            <p>Yes. We can implicitly insert a row for the identity column. Here is an example of doing this:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>SET&nbsp;IDENTITY_INSERT&nbsp;TABLE1&nbsp;ON&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;demo_table1&nbsp;(id,&nbsp;name,&nbsp;branch)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SELECT&nbsp;id,&nbsp;name,&nbsp;branch&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;demo_table2&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SET&nbsp;IDENTITY_INSERT&nbsp;OFF&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>65) What are SQL comments?</h3>

            <p>Comments are explanations or annotations in SQL queries that are readable by programmers. It&#39;s used
                to make SQL statements easier to understand for humans. During the parsing of SQL code, it will be
                ignored. Comments can be written on a single line or across several lines.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Line Comments:</strong>&nbsp;It starts with two consecutive hyphens (--).</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-line Comments:</strong>&nbsp;It starts with /* and ends with */.</li>
            </ul>
