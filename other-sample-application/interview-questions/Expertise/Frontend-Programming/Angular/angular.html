            <h1>Top Most Asked Angular Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

            <h3>1) What is Angular? / What do you know about Angular?</h3>

            <p>Angular is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks developed and maintained by Google. It is an
                open-source front-end web framework based on TypeScript. It is most suited for developing enterprise web
                applications because its code is reusable and maintainable.</p>

            <h3>2) What are some powerful features integrated into Angular?</h3>

            <p>Angular integrates some powerful features like declarative templates, end to end tooling, dependency
                injection and various other best practices that smoothens the development path.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>3) What is the main purpose of Angular?</h3>

            <p>The main purpose of using Angular is to create fast, dynamic and scalable web applications. We can create
                these applications very easily with Angular using components and directives.</p>

            <p>Angular was started as a SPA (Single-Page-Application) framework, and now it supports dynamic content
                based on different users through dependency injection. It provides a platform for easy development of
                web-based applications and empowers the front end developers in curating cross-platform applications.
                YouTubeTV is the most popular example that uses Angular.</p>

                        <td>AngularJS was the very first version initially released in 2010. It was a browser-side
                            JavaScript used within HTML code and created a revolution in web application development. It
                            is popularly known as AngularJS.</td>
                        <td>The later Angular versions were a complete rewrite of AngularJS. For example, Angular 2 was
                            initially released in 2016. There is nothing common between Angular2 and AngularJS except
                            the core developer&#39;s team. After that, Angular 6, Angular 7, Angular 8, Angular 9, and
                            Angular 10 were released that are very similar to each other. These later versions are known
                            as Angular.</td>

            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>6) What do you understand by Angular expressions? How are Angular expressions different from JavaScript
                expressions?</h3>

            <p>Angular expressions are code snippets that are used to bind application data to HTML. Angular resolves
                the expressions, and the result is returned to where the expression is written. Angular expressions are
                usually written in double braces: {{ expression }} similar to JavaScript.</p>

            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>

            <p>{{ expression }}</p>

            <p>Following is a list of some differences between Angular expressions and JavaScript expressions:</p>

            <p>1. The most crucial difference between Angular expressions and JavaScript expressions is that the Angular
                expressions allow us to write JavaScript in HTML. On the other hand, the JavaScript expressions
                don&#39;t allow.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2. The Angular expressions are evaluated against a local scope object. On the other hand, the JavaScript
                expressions are evaluated against the global window object. We can understand it better with an example.
                Suppose we have a component named test:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component,&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>selector:&nbsp;&#39;app-test&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>template:&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;h4&gt;{{message}}&lt;/h4&gt;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>styleUrls:&nbsp;[&#39;./test.component.css&#39;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;TestComponent&nbsp;implements&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>message:string&nbsp;=&nbsp;?Hello&nbsp;world?;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>constructor()&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>ngOnInit()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above example, we can see that the Angular expression is used to display the message property. In
                the present template, we are using Angular expressions, so we cannot access a property outside its local
                scope (in this case, TestComponent). This proves that Angular expressions are always evaluated based on
                the scope object rather than the global object.</p>

            <p>3. The Angular expressions can handle null and undefined, whereas JavaScript expressions cannot.</p>

            <p>See the following JavaScript example:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE&nbsp;html&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;html&nbsp;lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;head&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name=&quot;viewport&quot;&nbsp;content=&quot;width=device-width,&nbsp;initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;JavaScript&nbsp;Test&lt;/title&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;/head&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&nbsp;id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;/body&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;script&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;use&nbsp;strict&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;bar&nbsp;=&nbsp;{};&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById(&#39;foo&#39;).innerHTML&nbsp;=&nbsp;bar.x;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&lt;/script&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;/html&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After running the above code, you see undefined displayed on the screen. Although it&#39;s not ideal to
                leave any property undefined, the user does not need to see this.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Now see the following Angular example:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component,&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;app-new&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;template:&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h4&gt;{{message}}&lt;/h4&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`,&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;styleUrls:&nbsp;[&#39;./new.component.css&#39;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;NewComponent&nbsp;implements&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;message:object&nbsp;=&nbsp;{};&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor()&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;ngOnInit()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above example, you will not see undefined being displayed on the screen.</p>

            <p>4. In Angular expressions, we cannot use loops, conditionals, and exceptions. The difference which makes
                Angular expressions quite beneficial is the use of pipes. Angular uses pipes (known as filters in
                AngularJS) to format data before displaying it.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>See this example:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component,&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;app-new&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template:&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h4&gt;{{message&nbsp;|&nbsp;lowercase}}&lt;/h4&gt;,&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;styleUrls:&nbsp;[&#39;./new.component.css&#39;]&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export&nbsp;class&nbsp;NewComponent&nbsp;implements&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message:string&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;HELLO&nbsp;JAVATPOINT&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor()&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ngOnInit()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above example, we have used a predefined pipe called lowercase, which transforms all the letters
                in lowercase. If you run the above example, you will see the output displayed as &quot;hello
                javatpoint&quot;.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, JavaScript does not have the concept of pipes.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>7) What are templates in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, templates contain Angular-specific elements and attributes. These are written with HTML and
                combined with information coming from the model and controller, which are further rendered to provide
                the user&#39;s dynamic view.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>8) What is the difference between an Annotation and a Decorator in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, annotations are the &quot;only&quot; metadata set of the class using the Reflect Metadata
                library. They are used to create an &quot;annotation&quot; array. On the other hand, decorators are the
                design patterns used for separating decoration or modification of a class without actually altering the
                original source code.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>9) Why was Angular introduced as a client-side framework?</h3>

            <p>Before the introduction of Angular, web developers used VanillaJS and jQuery to develop dynamic websites.
                Later, when the websites became more complex with added features and functionality, it was hard for them
                to maintain the code. Along with this, there were no provisions of data handling facilities across the
                views by jQuery. The need for a client-side framework like Angular was obvious that can make life easier
                for the developers by handling separation of concerns and dividing code into smaller bits of information
                (components).</p>

            <p>Client-side frameworks like Angular facilitate developers to develop advanced web applications like
                Single-Page-Application. These applications can also be developed using VanillaJS, but the development
                process becomes slower by doing so.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) How does an Angular application work?</h3>

            <p>Every Angular app contains a file named angular.json. This file contains all the configurations of the
                app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the application&#39;s entry point.
                See the structure of the angular.json file:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&quot;build&quot;:&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;builder&quot;:&nbsp;&quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When the application enters the build section, the options object&#39;s main property defines the entry
                point of the application. The application&#39;s entry point is main.ts, which creates a browser
                environment for the application to run and calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the
                application.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>These two steps are performed in the following order inside the main.ts file:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;platformBrowserDynamic&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/platform-browser-dynamic&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above line of code, AppModule is getting bootstrapped.</p>

            <p>The AppModule is declared in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations of all the
                components.</p>

            <p><strong>Below is an example of app.module.ts file:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;BrowserModule&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import&nbsp;{&nbsp;NgModule&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import&nbsp;{&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;./app.component&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@NgModule({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declarations:&nbsp;[&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imports:&nbsp;[&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BrowserModule&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providers:&nbsp;[],&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entryComponents:&nbsp;[],&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bootstrap:&nbsp;[AppComponent]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AppModule&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above file, you can see that AppComponent is getting bootstrapped. It is defined in
                app.component.ts file. This file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it.</p>

            <p><strong>Below is an example of app.component.ts file:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;app-root&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;templateUrl:&nbsp;&#39;./app.component.html&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;styleUrls:&nbsp;[&#39;./app.component.css&#39;]&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;angular&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Each component is declared with three properties:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Selector -</strong>&nbsp;It is used to access the component.</li>
                <li><strong>Template/TemplateURL -</strong>&nbsp;It contains HTML of the component.</li>
                <li><strong>StylesURL -</strong>&nbsp;It contains component-specific stylesheets.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now, Angular calls the index.html file. This file consequently calls the root component that is app-root.
                The root component is defined in app.component.ts.</p>

            <p><strong>See how the index.html file looks like:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;html&nbsp;lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Angular&lt;/title&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;base&nbsp;href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name=&quot;viewport&quot;&nbsp;content=&quot;width=device-width,&nbsp;initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/html&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The HTML template of the root component is displayed inside the &lt;app-root&gt; tags.This is the way how
                every angular application works.</p>

            <h3>11) Why is Angular preferred over other frameworks? / What are some advantages of Angular over other
                frameworks?</h3>

            <p>Due to the following features, Angular is preferred over other frameworks:</p>

            <p><strong>Extraordinary Built-in Features:</strong>&nbsp;Angular provides several out of the box built-in
                features like routing, state management, RxJS library, Dependency Injection, HTTP services, etc.
                That&#39;s why the developers do not need to look for the above-stated features separately.</p>

            <p><strong>Declarative UI:</strong>&nbsp;Angular has declarative UI. It uses HTML to render the UI of an
                application as it is a declarative language. It is much easier to use than JavaScript.</p>

            <p><strong>Long-term Google Support:</strong>&nbsp;Angular is developed and maintained by Google. Google has
                a long term plan to stick with Angular and provide support.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) What are the different Lifecycle hooks of Angular? Explain them in short.</h3>

            <p>When the Angular components are created, they enter their lifecycle and remain when they are destroyed.
                Angular Lifecycle hooks are used to check the phases and trigger changes at specific phases during the
                entire duration.</p>

            <p><img alt="Angular Interview questions"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/top-angular-interview-questions-q12.png" /></p>

            <p><strong>ngOnChanges( ):</strong>&nbsp;This method is called when one or more input properties of the
                component are changed. The hook receives a SimpleChanges object containing the previous and current
                values of the property.</p>

            <p><strong>ngOnInit( ):</strong>&nbsp;This is the second lifecycle hook. It is called once, after the
                ngOnChanges hook. It is used to initialize the component and sets the input properties of the component.
            </p>

            <p><strong>ngDoCheck( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit and is used to
                detect and act on changes that Angular cannot detect. In this hook, we can implement our change
                detection algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>ngAfterContentInit( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called after the first ngDoCheck hook. This
                hook responds after the content gets projected inside the component.</p>

            <p><strong>ngAfterContentChecked( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called after ngAfterContentInit and every
                subsequent ngDoCheck. It responds after the projected content is checked.</p>

            <p><strong>ngAfterViewInit( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called after a component&#39;s view or
                initializing a child component&#39;s view.</p>

            <p><strong>ngAfterViewChecked( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called after ngAfterViewInit. It responds after
                the component&#39;s view or when the child component&#39;s view is checked.</p>

            <p><strong>ngOnDestroy( ):</strong>&nbsp;This hook is called just before Angular destroys the component.
                This is used to clean up the code and detach event handlers.</p>

            <p>In the above hooks we have described, the ngOnInit hook is the most often used hook. Let&#39;s see how to
                use the ngOnInit hook. If you have to process a lot of data during component creation, it&#39;s better
                to do it inside the ngOnInit hook rather than the constructor:</p>

            <p><strong>See the example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component,&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;app-test&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;templateUrl:&nbsp;&#39;./test.component.html&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;styleUrls:&nbsp;[&#39;./test.component.css&#39;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;TestComponent&nbsp;implements&nbsp;OnInit&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor()&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;ngOnInit()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.processData();&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;processData(){&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;Do&nbsp;something..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the above code, you can see that we have imported OnInit, but we have used the ngOnInit function. This
                is how we can use the rest of the hooks as well.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>13) What is AOT in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, AOT stands for Ahead-Of-Time compiler. It is used to convert your Angular HTML and TypeScript
                code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before the browser downloads and runs that
                code. By compiling the application during the build process provides a faster rendering in the browser.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>14) What is the reason for using the AOT compiler in Angular?</h3>

            <p>An Angular application is made of several components and their HTML templates. Because of these Angular
                components and templates, the browsers are not able to understand them directly. So, Angular
                applications require a compilation process before they run in a browser. That&#39;s why AOT compilers
                are required.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>15) What are the biggest advantages of AOT in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Following are the advantages of using the AOT compiler in Angular:</p>

            <p><strong>The rendering is faster:</strong>&nbsp;When we use the AOT compiler, the browser gets a
                pre-compiled version of the application to download. Here, the browser loads executable code to render
                the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first.</p>

            <p><strong>The Angular framework&#39;s download size is smaller:</strong>&nbsp;AOT facilitates you not to
                download the Angular compiler if the app is already compiled. The compiler is roughly half of Angular
                itself, so omitting it dramatically reduces the application payload.</p>

            <p><strong>Fewer asynchronous requests:</strong>&nbsp;The compiler is used to inline external HTML templates
                and CSS style sheets within the application JavaScript so, it eliminates separate AJAX requests for
                those source files.</p>

            <p><strong>Detect template errors earlier:</strong>&nbsp;While using the AOT compiler, developers can easily
                detect and report template binding errors during the build step before users can see them.</p>

            <p><strong>Better security:</strong>&nbsp;AOT provides better security because it compiles HTML templates
                and components into JavaScript files before they are served to the client. Because there are no
                templates to read and no risky client-side HTML or JavaScript evaluation, so the chances for injection
                attacks are very rare.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>16) What is JIT in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, JIT stands for Just-in-Time compiler. The JIT compiler provides a dynamic translation or
                run-time compilation, which provides a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during
                the execution of a program at run time rather than before execution.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>17) What is the main difference between JIT and AOT in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Following are the main differences between JIT and AOT compiler in Angular:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler compiles our app in the browser at run-time while Ahead-of-Time (AOT)
                    compiler is used to compile your app at build time on the server.</li>
                <li>The JIT compilation runs by default when you run the ng build (build only), or ng serve (build and
                    serve locally) CLI commands. This is used for development. On the other hand, we have to include the
                    --aot option with the ng build or ng serve command for AOT compilation.</li>
                <li>JIT and AOT are both two ways used to compile code in an Angular project. JIT compiler is used in
                    development mode while AOT is used for production mode.</li>
                <li>JIT is easy to use. We can easily implement features and debug in JIT mode because here we have a
                    map file while AOT does not. On the other hand, the biggest advantage of using AOT for production is
                    that it reduces the bundle size for faster rendering.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>18) What is the concept of scope hierarchy in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Angular provides the $scope objects into a hierarchy that is typically used by views. This is called the
                scope hierarchy in Angular. It has a root scope that can further contain one or several scopes called
                child scopes.</p>

            <p>In a scope hierarchy, each view has its own $scope. Hence, the variables set by a view&#39;s view
                controller will remain hidden to other view controllers.</p>

            <p><strong>Following is the typical representation of a Scope Hierarchy:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>Root&nbsp;$scope&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>$scope&nbsp;for&nbsp;Controller&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>$scope&nbsp;for&nbsp;Controller&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>$scope&nbsp;for&nbsp;Controller&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In Angular, as soon as we make a promise, the execution takes place, but this is not the case with
                observables because they are lazy. It means nothing happens until a subscription is made.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Promise</th>
                        <th>Observable</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>It emits a single value.</td>
                        <td>It emits multiple values over a period of time.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Not Lazy</td>
                        <td>Lazy. An observable is not called until we subscribe to the observable.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>We can not cancel<br />
                            it.</td>
                        <td>We can cancel it by using the unsubscribe() method.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                        <td>Observable provides operators like map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, retryWhen etc.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Let&#39;s understand it by an example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>const&nbsp;observable&nbsp;=&nbsp;rxjs.Observable.create(observer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;what&nbsp;inside&nbsp;an&nbsp;observable&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.next(&#39;Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.complete();&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;Before&nbsp;subscribing&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observable.subscribe((message)=&gt;&nbsp;console.log(message));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>When you run the above Observable, you can see the following messages displayed in the following order:
            </p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>Before&nbsp;subscribing&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>This&nbsp;is&nbsp;what&nbsp;inside&nbsp;an&nbsp;observable&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here, you can see that observables are lazy. Observable runs only when someone subscribes to them.
                That&#39;s why the message &quot;Before subscribing an Observable&quot; is displayed ahead of the
                message inside the observable.</p>

            <p><strong>Now see the example of a Promise:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>const&nbsp;promise&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Promise((resolve,&nbsp;reject)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;what&nbsp;written&nbsp;inside&nbsp;promise&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolve(&#39;Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;Before&nbsp;calling&nbsp;then&nbsp;method&nbsp;on&nbsp;Promise&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greetingPoster.then(message&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;console.log(message));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>When you run the above Promise, you will see the messages displayed in the following order:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>This&nbsp;is&nbsp;what&nbsp;written&nbsp;inside&nbsp;Promise&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Before&nbsp;calling&nbsp;then&nbsp;method&nbsp;on&nbsp;Promise&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here, you can see that the message inside Promise is displayed first. This means that the Promise runs
                first, and then the method is called.</p>

            <p>The next difference between them is that Promises are always asynchronous; even when the Promise is
                immediately resolved. On the other hand, an Observable can be both synchronous and asynchronous.</p>

            <p>In the case of the above example, observable is synchronous. Let&#39;s see the case where an observable
                can be asynchronous:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>const&nbsp;observable&nbsp;=&nbsp;rxjs.Observable.create(observer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(()=&gt;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.next(&#39;Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.complete();&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;},3000)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>});&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>console.log(&#39;Before&nbsp;calling&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>observable.subscribe((data)=&gt;&nbsp;console.log(data));&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>console.log(&#39;After&nbsp;calling&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>When you run the above observable, you will see the messages in the following order:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>Before&nbsp;calling&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>After&nbsp;calling&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Observable&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>22) What are directives in Angular?</h3>

            <p>A directive is a class in Angular that is declared with a @Directive decorator. Every directive has its
                own behavior, and you can import them into various components of an application.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>23) What were the main reasons behind introducing client-side frameworks like Angular?</h3>

            <p>Before Angular was introduced, the web developers used VanillaJS and jQuery to develop dynamic websites,
                but the biggest drawback of these technologies is that as the logic of the website grew, the code became
                more and more complex to maintain. For websites and applications that use complex logic, developers had
                to put in extra effort to maintain the separation of concerns for the app. Also, jQuery did not provide
                facilities for data handling across views.</p>

            <p>The client-side frameworks like Angular were introduced to overcome the above problems. It provides
                developers many benefits over VanilaJS and jQuery by providing a new feature called components for
                handling separation of concerns and dividing code into smaller bits of information.</p>

            <p>Client-side frameworks such as Angular facilitate developers to develop advanced web applications like
                Single-Page-Applications. So, the main reasons behind introducing Angular were to create fast, dynamic,
                and scalable web applications easily.</p>

            <h4>Note: We can also develop dynamic websites and SPAs (Single Page Applications) using VanillaJS, and
                jQuery but by doing so, the development process becomes slower.</h4>

            <h3>24) What is Angular CLI?</h3>

            <p>Angular CLI is a short form for Angular Command Line Interface. It is a command-line interface to
                scaffold and build angular apps using node.js style modules.</p>

            <p>To use Angular CLI, we have to install it by using the following&nbsp;<strong>npm</strong>&nbsp;command:
            </p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>npm&nbsp;install&nbsp;@angular/cli@latest&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Following is a list of some useful commands which would be very helpful while creating angular
                    projects:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creating New Project:</strong>&nbsp;ng new</li>
                <li><strong>Generating Components, Directives &amp; Services:</strong>&nbsp;ng generate/g</li>
                <li><strong>Running the Project:</strong>&nbsp;ng serve</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>25) What is lazy loading in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Lazy loading is one of the most powerful and useful concepts of Angular Routing. It makes the web pages
                easy to download by downloading them in chunks instead of downloading everything in a big bundle. Lazy
                loading facilitates asynchronously loading the feature module for routing whenever required using the
                property loadChildren.</p>

            <p>See the following example where we are going to load both Employee and Order feature modules lazily.</p>

            <p><strong>See the example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>const&nbsp;routes:&nbsp;Routes&nbsp;=&nbsp;[&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path:&nbsp;&#39;employees&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loadChildren:&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;import(&#39;./employees/employees.module&#39;).then(module&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;module.EmployeesModule)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;},&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path:&nbsp;&#39;orders&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loadChildren:&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;import(&#39;./orders/orders.module&#39;).then(module&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;module.OrdersModule)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;},&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path:&nbsp;&#39;&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redirectTo:&nbsp;&#39;&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathMatch:&nbsp;&#39;full&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>];&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>26) What is Angular Router?</h3>

            <p>Angular Router is a mechanism that facilitates users to navigate from one view to the next as users
                perform application tasks. It follows the concept model of browser&#39;s application navigation.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>27) What do you understand by the router imports?</h3>

            <p>The Angular Router, representing a particular component view for a given URL, is not part of Angular
                Core. It is available in a library named @angular/router, and we have to import the required router
                components. This process is called router imports.</p>

            <p>See the following example of how we can import them in the app module:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;RouterModule,&nbsp;Routes&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/router&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>28) What do you understand by RouterOutlet and RouterLink?</h3>

            <p>A RouterOutlet is a directive from the router library that acts as a placeholder. It marks the spot in
                the template where the Router should display the components for that outlet. Router outlet is used as a
                component.</p>

            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>On the other hand, a RouterLink is a directive on the anchor tags that gives the router control over
                those elements. Since the navigation paths are fixed, you can assign string values to router-link
                directive as below,</p>

            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;h1&gt;Angular&nbsp;Router&lt;/h1&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;nav&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;routerLink=&quot;/todosList&quot;&nbsp;&gt;List&nbsp;of&nbsp;todos&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;routerLink=&quot;/completed&quot;&nbsp;&gt;Completed&nbsp;todos&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&lt;/nav&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>29) What are the different router events used in Angular Router?</h3>

            <p>During each navigation, the Router emits navigation events through the Router.events property. It allows
                us to track the lifecycle of the route.</p>

            <p><strong>Following is the list of different router events in sequence:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>NavigationStart</li>
                <li>RouteConfigLoadStart</li>
                <li>RouteConfigLoadEnd</li>
                <li>RoutesRecognized</li>
                <li>GuardsCheckStart</li>
                <li>ChildActivationStart</li>
                <li>ActivationStart</li>
                <li>GuardsCheckEnd</li>
                <li>ResolveStart</li>
                <li>ResolveEnd</li>
                <li>ActivationEnd</li>
                <li>ChildActivationEnd</li>
                <li>NavigationEnd</li>
                <li>NavigationCancel</li>
                <li>NavigationError</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>30) What do you understand by the RouterLinkActive?</h3>

            <p>The RouterLinkActive is a directive used to toggle CSS classes for active RouterLink bindings based on
                the current RouterState. i.e., the Router will add CSS classes when this link is active and remove them
                when the link is inactive.</p>

            <p>For example, you can add them to RouterLinks as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;h1&gt;Angular&nbsp;Router&lt;/h1&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;nav&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;routerLink=&quot;/todosList&quot;&nbsp;routerLinkActive=&quot;active&quot;&gt;List&nbsp;of&nbsp;todos&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;routerLink=&quot;/completed&quot;&nbsp;routerLinkActive=&quot;active&quot;&gt;Completed&nbsp;todos&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&lt;/nav&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>31) What do you understand by the RouterState?</h3>

            <p>The RouterState is a tree of activated routes. Every node in this tree knows about the
                &quot;consumed&quot; URL segments, the extracted parameters, and the resolved data. We can access the
                current RouterState from anywhere in the application by using the Router service and the routerState
                property.</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>@Component({templateUrl:&#39;template.html&#39;})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>class&nbsp;MyComponent&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(router:&nbsp;Router)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;state:&nbsp;RouterState&nbsp;=&nbsp;router.routerState;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;root:&nbsp;ActivatedRoute&nbsp;=&nbsp;state.root;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;child&nbsp;=&nbsp;root.firstChild;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;id:&nbsp;Observable&lt;string&gt;&nbsp;=&nbsp;child.params.map(p&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;p.id);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>

            <h3>32) What is HttpClient, and what are the advantages of it?</h3>

            <p>Most front-end applications use either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API to communicate with
                backend services over HTTP protocol. For the same purpose, Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API
                known as HttpClient. This is based on top of XMLHttpRequest interface. This HttpClient is available in
                the @angular/common/http package, which you can import in your root module as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;HttpClientModule&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/common/http&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Following are some of the crucial advantages of HttpClient:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>HttpClient contains testability features.</li>
                <li>It provides typed request and response objects.</li>
                <li>It can intercept requests and responses.</li>
                <li>It supports Observalbe APIs.</li>
                <li>HttpClient also supports streamlined error handling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>33) By default, Angular uses client-side rendering for its applications. Is it possible to make an
                Angular application to render on the server-side?</h3>

            <p>Yes, it is possible to make an Angular application to render on the server-side. Angular provides a
                technology called Angular Universal that can be used to render applications on the server-side.</p>

            <p>The crucial advantages of using Angular Universal are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Making an Angular application render on the server-side can provide a better user experience. By
                    using this, first-time users can instantly see a view of the application. So, it can be used to
                    provide better UI.</li>
                <li>It can lead to a better SEO for your application. The reason is that many search engines expect
                    pages in plain HTML. So, Angular Universal can ensure that your content is available on every search
                    engine, and it is good for better SEO.</li>
                <li>The server-side rendered applications load faster than normal pages. It is because the rendered
                    pages are available to the browser sooner.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>34) What is the best way to perform Error handling in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Error is when the request fails on the server or fails to reach the server due to network issues. In this
                condition, HttpClient returns an error object instead of a successful response. To resolve this issue,
                we must handle the component by passing the error object as a second callback to the subscribe() method.
            </p>

            <p><strong>See the following example to understand how we handle in the component:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>fetchUser()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;this.userService.getProfile()&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.subscribe(&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(data:&nbsp;User)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;this.userProfile&nbsp;=&nbsp;{&nbsp;...data&nbsp;},&nbsp;//&nbsp;success&nbsp;path&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;this.error&nbsp;=&nbsp;error&nbsp;//&nbsp;error&nbsp;path&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You can write an error message to give the user some meaningful feedback instead of displaying the raw
                error object returned from HttpClient.</p>

            <h3>35) What do you understand by Angular bootstrapping?</h3>

            <p>Angular bootstrapping is nothing but to allow developers to initialize or start the Angular application.
                Angular supports two types of bootstrapping:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Manual bootstrapping</li>
                <li>Automatic bootstrapping</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Manual bootstrapping:</strong>&nbsp;Manual bootstrapping provides more control to developers and
                facilitates them regarding how and when they need to initialize the Angular app. It is useful when
                professionals wish to perform other tasks and operations before Angular compiles the page.</p>

            <p><strong>Automatic bootstrapping:</strong>&nbsp;As the name specifies, automatic bootstrapping is started
                automatically to start the Angular app. The developers need to add the ng-app directive to the
                application&#39;s root if they want Angular to bootstrap the application automatically. Angular loads
                the associated module once it finds the ng-app directive and, further, compiles the DOM.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>36) What is the digest cycle process in Angular?</h3>

            <p>The digest cycle process in Angular is the process that is used to monitor the watchlist to track changes
                in the watch variable value. There is a comparison between the present and the previous versions of the
                scope model values in each digest cycle.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>37) What are the key differences between a Component and a Directive in Angular?</h3>

            <p>A Component is a directive that uses shadow DOM to create encapsulated visual behavior. Usually,
                components are used to create UI widgets by breaking up the application into smaller parts. In short, we
                can say that a component (@component) is a directive-with-a-template.</p>

            <p><strong>A list of the major differences between a Component and a Directive in Angular:</strong></p>

            <table>

                    <tr>
                        <td>We use @Component meta-data annotation attributes to register a component.</td>

                        <td>It is used to break up the application into smaller parts called components.</td>
                        <td>It is used to design re-usable components.</td>
                    </tr>

            <h3>38) What do you understand by Angular MVVM architecture?</h3>

            <p>The MVVM architecture or&nbsp;<strong>Model-View-ViewModel</strong>&nbsp;architecture is a software
                architectural pattern that provides a facility to developers to separate the development of the
                graphical user interface (the View) from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the
                Model). By using this architecture, the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.</p>

            <p>The Angular MVVM architecture consists of the following three parts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Model</li>
                <li>View</li>
                <li>ViewModel</li>
            </ul>

            <p><img alt="Angular Interview questions"
                    src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/top-angular-interview-questions-q38.png" /></p>

            <p><strong>Model:</strong>&nbsp;The Model consists of the structure of an entity and specifies the approach.
                In simple words, we can say that the model contains data of an object.</p>

            <p><strong>View:</strong>&nbsp;The View is the visual layer of the application. It specifies the structure,
                layout, and appearance of what a user sees on the screen. It displays the data inside the Model,
                represents the model, and receives the user&#39;s interaction with the view in the form of mouse clicks,
                keyboard input, screen tap gestures, etc., and forwards these to the ViewModel via the data binding
                properties. In Angular terms, the View contains the HTML template of a component.</p>

            <p><strong>ViewModel:</strong>&nbsp;The ViewModel is an abstract layer of the application. It is used to
                handle the logic of the application. It also manages the data of a model and displays it in the view.
                View and ViewModel are connected with two-way data-binding. If you make any changes in the view, the
                ViewModel takes a note and changes the appropriate data inside the model.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>39) What is the purpose of AsyncPipe in Angular?</h3>

            <p>The AsyncPipe is used to subscribe to an observable or promise and return the latest value it has
                emitted. When a new value is emitted, the pipe marks the component that has been checked for changes.
            </p>

            <p>See the following example where a time observable continuously updates the view for every 2 seconds with
                the current time.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>@Component({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;async-observable-pipe&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;template:&nbsp;`&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;observable|async&lt;/code&gt;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time:&nbsp;{{&nbsp;time&nbsp;|&nbsp;async&nbsp;}}&lt;/div&gt;`&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AsyncObservablePipeComponent&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Observable(observer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setInterval(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;observer.next(new&nbsp;Date().toString()),&nbsp;2000)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>40) What do you understand by services in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, services are singleton objects that get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an
                application. An Angular service contains methods that are used to maintain the data throughout the life
                of an application. Angular services are used to organize as well as share business logic, models, or
                data and functions with various components of an Angular application.</p>

            <p>Angular services offer some functions that can be invoked from an Angular component, such as a controller
                or directive.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>41) What is the key difference between a constructor and ngOnInit?</h3>

            <p>Constructor is a default method in TypeScript classes that are normally used for the initialization
                purpose. On the other hand, the ngOnInit is specifically an Angular method and is used to define Angular
                bindings. Even though constructors are getting called first, it is always preferred to move all of your
                Angular bindings to the ngOnInit method.</p>

            <p>See the following example how we can use ngOnInit by implementing OnInit interface as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;App&nbsp;implements&nbsp;OnInit{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(){&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//called&nbsp;first&nbsp;time&nbsp;before&nbsp;the&nbsp;ngOnInit()&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;ngOnInit(){&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//called&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;constructor&nbsp;and&nbsp;called&nbsp;&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;ngOnChanges()&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>42) What do you understand by observable and observer in Angular?</h3>

            <p><strong>Observable:</strong>&nbsp;An observable is a unique object just like a promise that that is used
                to manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so the developers have to rely
                on a popular Observable library called RxJS. The observables are created using the new keyword.</p>

            <p>See a simple example of observable to understand it better:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Observable&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;rxjs&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>const&nbsp;observable&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Observable(observer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.next(&#39;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;message&nbsp;from&nbsp;Observable!&#39;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;},&nbsp;1000);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>});&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Observer:</strong>&nbsp;Any object that has to be notified when the state of another object
                changes is called an observer. An observer is an interface for push-based notifications delivered by an
                Observable.</p>

            <p><strong>See the structure of an observer:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>interface&nbsp;Observer&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;closed?:&nbsp;boolean;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;next:&nbsp;(value:&nbsp;T)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;void;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;error:&nbsp;(err:&nbsp;any)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;void;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;complete:&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;void;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The handler that implements the observer interface for receiving observable notifications is passed as a
                parameter for observable as follows:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Note: If you don&#39;t use a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that
                type.</h4>

            <hr />
            <h3>43) How do you categorize data binding types in Angular?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, we can categorize data binding types in three categories distinguished by the direction of
                data flow. These data binding categories are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>From the source-to-view</li>
                <li>From view-to-source</li>
                <li>View-to-source-to-view</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let&#39;s see their possible binding syntax:</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data direction</th>
                        <th>Syntax</th>
                        <th>Type</th>

            <p>Multicasting or Multi-casting is the practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a
                single execution.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take a simple example to demonstrate the multi-casting feature:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>var&nbsp;source&nbsp;=&nbsp;Rx.Observable.from([1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3]);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>var&nbsp;subject&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Rx.Subject();&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>var&nbsp;multicasted&nbsp;=&nbsp;source.multicast(subject);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>//&nbsp;These&nbsp;are,&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;hood,&nbsp;`subject.subscribe({...})`:&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>multicasted.subscribe({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;next:&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;observerA:&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;+&nbsp;v)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>});&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>multicasted.subscribe({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;next:&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;console.log(&#39;observerB:&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;+&nbsp;v)&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>});&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>45) What do you understand by Angular Material?</h3>

            <p>Angular Material is a UI component library that is used by professionals to develop consistent,
                attractive, and completely functional websites, web pages, and web applications. It follows the modern
                principles of web designing, such as graceful degradation and browser probability, and is capable of
                doing a lot of fascinating things in website and application development.</p>

            <h3>46) What is lazy loading in Angular? Why is it used?</h3>

            <p>In Angular, the by default tendency of NgModules is eagerly loaded. It means that as soon as the app
                loads, all the NgModules are loaded, whether or not they are immediately necessary. That&#39;s why lazy
                loading is required. Lazy loading is mandatory for large apps with lots of routes. This design pattern
                makes the app load NgModules when they are only required. Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes
                smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times.</p>

            <h3>47) What is the use of Angular filters? What are its distinct types?</h3>

            <p>Filters are an essential part of Angular that helps in formatting the expression value to show it to the
                users. We can easily add filters to services, directives, templates, or controllers. We can also create
                personalized filters as per requirements. These filters allow us to organize the data in such a way that
                only the data that meets the respective criteria are displayed. Filters are placed after the pipe symbol
                ( | ) while used in expressions.</p>

            <p><strong>A list of various types of filters used in Angular:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>currency:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to convert numbers to the currency format.</li>
                <li><strong>filter:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to select a subset containing items from the given array.
                </li>
                <li><strong>date:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to convert a date into a necessary format.</li>
                <li><strong>lowercase:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to convert the given string into lowercase.</li>
                <li><strong>uppercase:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to convert the given string into uppercase.</li>
                <li><strong>orderBy: It</strong>&nbsp;is used to arrange an array by the given expression.</li>
                <li><strong>json:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to format any object into a JSON string.</li>
                <li><strong>number:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to convert a numeric value into a string.</li>
                <li><strong>limitTo:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to restrict the limit of a given string or array to a
                    particular number of elements or strings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>48) When do we use a directive in Angular?</h3>

            <p>If you create an Angular application where multiple components need to have similar functionalities, you
                have to do it by adding this functionality individually to every component. This is not a very easy
                task. Directives are used to cope up with this situation. Here, we can create a directive with the
                required functionality and then import the directive to components that require this functionality.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>49) What are the different types of directives in Angular?</h3>

            <p>There are mainly three types of directives in Angular:</p>

            <p><strong>Component Directives:</strong>&nbsp;The component directives are used to form the main class in
                directives. To declare these directives, we have to use the @Component decorator instead of @Directive
                decorator. These directives have a view, a stylesheet and a selector property.</p>

            <p><strong>Structural directives:</strong>&nbsp;These directives are generally used to manipulate DOM
                elements. The structural directive has a &#39; * &#39; sign before them. We can apply these directives
                to any DOM element.</p>

            <p><strong>Following are some example of built-in structural directives:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>*ngIf Structural Directive:</strong>&nbsp;*ngIf is used to check a Boolean value and if it&#39;s
                truthy, the div element will be displayed.</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;div&nbsp;*ngIf=&quot;isReady&quot;&nbsp;class=&quot;display_name&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{name}}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>*ngFor Structural Directive:</strong>&nbsp;*ngFor is used to iterate over a list and display each
                item of the list.</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;div&nbsp;class=&quot;details&quot;&nbsp;*ngFor=&quot;let&nbsp;x&nbsp;of&nbsp;details&quot;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;{{x.name}}&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;{{x.address}}&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;{{x.age}}&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Attribute Directives:</strong>&nbsp;The attribute directives are used to change the look and
                behavior of a DOM element. Let&#39;s create an attribute directive to understand it well:</p>

            <p><strong>This is how we can create a custom directive:</strong></p>

            <p>Go to the command terminal, navigate to the directory of the angular app and type the following command
                to generate a directive:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>ng&nbsp;g&nbsp;directive&nbsp;yellowBackground&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This will generate the following directive. Manipulate the directive to look like this:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Directive,&nbsp;ElementRef&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@Directive({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;[appYellowBackground]&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;YellowBackgroundDirective&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;constructor(el:ElementRef)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;yellow&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now, you can easily apply the above directive to any DOM element:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;p&nbsp;appYellowBackground&gt;Hello&nbsp;JavaTpoint&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>50) What are string interpolation and property binding in Angular?</h3>

            <p>String interpolation and property binding are parts of data-binding in Angular. Data-binding is a feature
                of Angular, which is used to provide a way to communicate between the component (Model) and its view
                (HTML template). There are two ways of data-binding, one-way data binding and two-way data binding. In
                Angular, data from the component can be inserted inside the HTML template. Any changes in the component
                will directly reflect inside the HTML template in one-way binding, but vice-versa is not possible. On
                the other hand, it is possible in two-way binding.</p>

            <p>String interpolation and property binding both are examples of one-way data binding. They allow only
                one-way data binding.</p>

            <p><strong>String Interpolation:</strong>&nbsp;String interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ }} to
                display data from the component. Angular automatically runs the expression written inside the curly
                braces. For example, {{ 5+5 }} will be evaluated by Angular, and the output will be 10. This output will
                be displayed inside the HTML template.</p>

            <p><strong>Property Binding:</strong>&nbsp;Property binding is used to bind the DOM properties of an HTML
                element to a component&#39;s property. In property binding, we use the square brackets [ ] syntax.</p>

            <h3>51) Is it possible to make an angular application to render on the server-side?</h3>

            <p>Yes, we can make an angular application to render on the server-side. Angular provides a technology
                Angular Universal that makes you able to render applications on the server-side.</p>

            <p><strong>Following are the benefits of using Angular Universal:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Better User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;It enables users to see the view of the application
                instantly.</p>

            <p><strong>Better SEO:</strong>&nbsp;Angular Universal ensures that the content is available on every search
                engine leading to better SEO.</p>

            <p><strong>Load Faster:</strong>&nbsp;Angular Universal ensures that the render pages available to the
                browsers sooner to make the loading faster server-side application loads faster.</p>

            <h3>52) What is Dependency Injection in Angular?</h3>

            <p>Dependency injection is an application design pattern that is implemented by Angular. It is used to form
                the core concepts of Angular. Dependencies are services in Angular which have some specific
                functionality. Various components and directives in an application can need these functionalities of the
                service. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which these dependencies are injected into components
                and directives.</p>

            <h3>53) Can you demonstrate navigation between different routes in an Angular application?</h3>

            <p>You can demonstrate the navigation between different routes in an Angular app in the following way. See
                the following code to demonstrate navigation in an Angular app named &quot;My First App.&quot;</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;from&nbsp;&quot;@angular/router&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <hr />
            <h3>11) What is the usage of Codelyzer?</h3>

            <p>Codelyzer is an open-source tool in Angular 8 that sits on top of TSLint. It is used to check whether
                Angular TypeScript projects follow a set of rules or not. It also checks the errors in codes, not
                following pre-defined rules. It contains more than 50 rules for checking if an Angular application
                follows best practices. It runs on the tslint.json file and checks only the static code in Angular 8.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Codelyzer is by default inbuilt with the projects set up with the Angular command-line interface (CLI).
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) How Angular 8 has enhanced the performance over its previous versions?</h3>

            <p>Angular 8 consists of advanced level features such as differential loading, CLI workflow improvements,
                Dynamic imports for lazy routes, Ivy rendering engine, Bazel, etc. which ensure systematic workflow and
                performance improvements.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>13) What do you mean by Ivy in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Ivy is the code name for next-generation compilation and Rendering pipeline or Rendering Engine. It was
                released in Angular 8 as Opt-in. At the release of Angular 9, Ivy was intended to be the by default
                rendering engine instead of the older compiler and runtime, known as View Engine.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>14) What is the usage of Wildcard Route in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>In Angular 8, the Wildcard Router is used to set a route when the requested URL doesn&#39;t match any
                router paths. After using the Wildcard Router, the set route matches to every&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://www.javatpoint.com/url-full-form">URL</a></p>

            <p>as an instruction to get a clear client-generated view. This Wildcard route always comes last as it needs
                to perform its task at the end only. So, the Wildcard Router is mainly used to define the route of the
                pages in Angular 8.</p>

            <h3>19) What are the most important parts of the Angular 8 Architecture?</h3>

            <p>The architecture of an Angular 8 application follows some fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks
                are NgModules that are used to provide compilation context for components and collect related code into
                functional sets. A set of NgModules are used to define an Angular app.</p>

            <p>Following is the list of most important parts of the Angular 8 architecture:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Modules</li>
                <li>Components</li>
                <li>Templates</li>
                <li>MetaData</li>
                <li>Data-Binding</li>
                <li>Directives</li>
                <li>Services</li>
                <li>Dependency Injection</li>

            <h3>20) What is the requirement and usage of Angular 8 components?</h3>

            <p>The Angular 8 components are the list of classes with decorators that mainly mark their own types and
                provide metadata that guide Angular to do things.</p>

            <p>Every Angular application always has at least one component known as a root component that connects a
                page hierarchy with page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic
                and is associated with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tutorial">HTML</a></p>

            <p>template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>21) What is the usage of NgUpgrade in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>The NgModules in Angular 8 is used for the following things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The NgModule is a class marked by the @NgModule decorator where the @NgModule decorator is used to
                    take a metadata object that describes how to compile a component&#39;s template and how to create an
                    injector at runtime.</li>
                <li>The NgModules is used to configure the injector and the compiler and also help to organize the
                    related things together.</li>
                <li>The NgModule is used to identify the module&#39;s own components, directives, and pipes. It can also
                    make some of them public, through the exports property, to facilitate external components to use
                    them.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>22) What is the usage of NgUpgrade in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>The NgUpgrade is an Angular 8 library mainly used to integrate both AngularJS and Angular components in
                the application. The NgUpgrade library is also used to bridge the gap between the Dependency Injection
                Systems in both AngularJS and Angular.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>23) What is the usage of Angular 8 ngFor Directive?</h3>

            <p>The Angular 8 ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of the HTML template once per each item from an
                iterable list (Collection). The ngFor is an Angular structural directive and is similar to ngRepeat in
                AngularJS. Some local variables like Index, First, Last, odd, and even are exported by ngFor directive.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Syntax for ngFor Directive</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">

            <h3>24) What is the usage of Angular 8 ngIf Directive?</h3>

            <p>The Angular 8 ngIf directive is a structural directive that is used to add or remove HTML elements
                according to the expression. The expression must return a Boolean value true or false. You can see the
                functioning of nglf directive clearly. If the expression is false, then the element is removed.
                Otherwise, the element is inserted. It is similar to the ng-if directive of AngularJS.</p>

            <p><strong>Syntax for ngIf Directive</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;p&nbsp;*ngIf=&quot;condition&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <h3>25) What is data binding in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Data Binding is one of the key concepts of Angular 8. It is the most eminent technique which is used to
                link your data to the view layer. It is used to make a communication between the DOM and the TypeScript
                code of your component. In simple words, you can say that data binding is a communication between the
                typescript code of your component and your template, which the user sees. It makes it easy to define
                interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data.</p>

            <p>There are two types of data binding i.e., one-way data binding, two-way data binding.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>26) What is String Interpolation in Angular 8, and why is it used?</h3>

            <p>String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique in Angular 8. It is used to extract the output
                data from a TypeScript code to the HTML template view layer. It shows the data from the component to
                view layer in the form of curly braces. This interpolation technique adds the value of property to the
                component.</p>

            <p><strong>String Interpolation Example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>{{data}}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <h3>27) What is the Purpose of Event Binding in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Event binding is a technique in Angular 8 used to handle the events raised from the DOM like button
                click, mouse move etc. When the DOM event happens (eg. click, change, keyup, keydown), it calls the
                specified method in the component.</p>

            <p>See an example of event binding. In this example, the playMusic() method from the component will be
                called when you will click the button:</p>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>&lt;button&nbsp;(click)=&quot;playMusic()&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>28) How can you create an app in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>You can easily create an Angular 8 web app using Angular CLI. Type the following command to create the
                Angular 8 web app.</p>

            <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>ng&nbsp;new&nbsp;angular_app_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>ng&nbsp;new&nbsp;myapp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The above command will create an Angular 8 app with the name &quot;<strong>myapp</strong>.&quot; Then,
                the Angular CLI will automatically install the required NPM modules. Before this, you must ensure that
                you have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/nodejs-tutorial">Node.js</a></p>

            <p>, Angular 8, and installed Angular CLI using the following command:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>npm&nbsp;install&nbsp;-g&nbsp;@angular/cli&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You can also manually create an app folder and install ng dependencies.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>29) What is the main purpose of Angular 8 forms?</h3>

            <p>The main purpose of Angular 8 forms is to handle the user&#39;s input. You can also use these Angular
                forms in your application to enable users to log in, update profiles, enter information, or perform many
                other data-entry tasks.</p>

            <p>There are two approaches to handle the user&#39;s input through forms in Angular 8:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reactive forms</li>
                <li>Template-driven forms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Both approaches are used to collect user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a
                form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>30) What is the use of reactive forms in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Reactive forms use a model-driven approach to handle form inputs where values constantly change over
                time. It uses an explicit and immutable approach to manage the state of a form at a specific time. Every
                time the changes occur to the form state, it returns a new state. The reactive forms are used mainly for
                the following features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reactive forms are more robust than template-driven forms.</li>
                <li>Reactive forms are more scalable, reusable, and testable.</li>
                <li>Reactive forms are preferred to use when the forms are a key part of the application, or the
                    application is already built using reactive patterns. In both cases, reactive forms are best to use.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>31) What are the benefits of using Template-driven forms in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Following are the benefits of using Template-driven forms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You should use Template-driven forms if you want to add a simple form to your application because
                    template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component. By using
                    this, you can see the changes instantly as you make changes in the template and vice versa.</li>
                <li>Template-driven forms are easy to use in the application, but they are not as scalable as Reactive
                    forms, so they are preferred to use in test applications for learning purposes.</li>
                <li>Template-driven forms are mainly used if your application requires a very basic form and logic. It
                    can easily be managed in a template.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>32) What is the difference between reactive forms and Template-driven forms in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>Both Reactive forms and Template-driven forms are used to manage and process data differently. Each form
                offers different advantages. Here, we have compared both forms to see the differences:</p>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Reactive forms are more robust, so they are best to use.</td>
                        <td>Template-driven forms are best if you want to add a simple form to your application. For

            <h3>33) What do you mean by Angular Universal?</h3>

            <p>Angular Universal is a technology that is used to render Angular applications on the server. This process
                is called SSR (server-side rendering). A simple Angular application is executed on the browser as all
                the Angular applications are single-page applications, so the rendering always occurs on the browser.
                This process of rendering single-page applications is called the client-side rendering process (CSR). On
                the other hand, the Angular Universal is executed on the server, generating static application pages
                that later get bootstrapped on the client. That&#39;s why Angular Universal application generally
                renders more quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully
                interactive.</p>

            <h3>34) What is AOT in Angular 8?</h3>

            <p>In Angular 8, AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time compiler. It pre-compiles the application components and their
                templates during the build process.</p>

            <p>There are several reasons why apps compiled with AOT launch faster:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The application components that are compiled with AOT execute immediately, without client-side
                    compilation.</li>
                <li>Here, templates are embedded as code within their components, so there is no client-side request for
                    template files. That&#39;s why it is fast.</li>
                <li>The compiler doesn&#39;t entertain the unused Angular directives. It&#39;s also a reason for its
                    fast response.</li>

            <h3>4) What is the difference between structural directive and attribute directive in Angular 7?</h3>

            <p><strong>Structural directives</strong>&nbsp;are used to alter the DOM layout by removing and adding DOM
                elements. These directives are far better in changing the structure of the view. Examples of Structural
                directives are NgFor and Nglf.</p>

            <p><strong>Attribute Directives</strong>&nbsp;are used as characteristics of elements. For example, a
                directive such as built-in NgStyle in the template Syntax guide is an attribute directive.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>5) What is the difference among &quot;declarations&quot;, &quot;providers&quot; and &quot;import&quot;
                in NgModule?</h3>

            <p><strong>Difference among declarations&quot;, &quot;providers&quot; and &quot;import&quot; in
                    NgModule:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>declarations</strong>&nbsp;are used to make directives (including components and pipes) from
                    the current module available to other directives in the current module. Selectors of directives,
                    components or pipes are only matched against the HTML if they are declared or imported.</li>
                <li><strong>providers</strong>&nbsp;are used to make services and values known to DI. They are added to
                    the root scope and they are injected to other services or directives that have them as dependency. A
                    special case for providers is lazy loaded modules that get their own child injector. Providers of a
                    lazy loaded module are only provided to this lazy loaded module by default (not the whole
                    application as it is with other modules).</li>
                <li><strong>import</strong>&nbsp;makes the exported declarations of other modules available in the
                    current module.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>6) What are the key components of Angular?</h3>

            <p>Key components of Angular:</p>

            <p><strong>Components:</strong>&nbsp;Components are the basic building blocks of angular application and
                used to control HTML views.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Modules:</strong>&nbsp;Modules are the set of angular basic building blocks like component,
                directives, services etc. An application is divided into logical pieces and each piece of code is called
                as &quot;module&quot; and used to perform a single task.</p>

            <p><strong>Templates:</strong>&nbsp;Templates are used to represent the views of an Angular application.</p>

            <p><strong>Services:</strong>&nbsp;It is used to create components which can be shared across the entire
                application.</p>

            <p><strong>Metadata:</strong>&nbsp;This can be used to add more data to an Angular class.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>7) Explain the Architecture overview of Angular.</h3>

            <p>Angular is the most popular web development framework for developing mobile and web applications. It uses
                cross platform mobile development called IONIC that&#39;s why it is not limited to web apps only.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>There are 7 main building blocks of an Angular application:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Component</li>
                <li>Templates</li>
                <li>Metadata</li>
                <li>Data Binding</li>
                <li>Directives</li>
                <li>Services</li>
                <li>Dependency Injection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context
                for components. Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules and it always has at least a root module
                that enables bootstrapping, and many more feature modules.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Components define Template views</li>
                <li>Components use services</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The NgModules make developers to organize an application into connected blocks of functionality.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The NgModule properties for the minimum &quot;AppModule&quot; generated by the CLI are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Declarations:</strong>&nbsp;Use to declare the application components.</li>
                <li><strong>Imports:</strong>&nbsp;Every application must import BrowserModule to run the app in a
                    browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Providers:</strong>&nbsp;There are none to start.</li>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong>&nbsp;This is a root AppComponent that Angular creates and inserts into
                    the index.html host web page.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h3>8) How would you update Angular 6 to Angular 7?</h3>

            <p>You can update Angular 6 to Angular 7 by using the following command:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>ng&nbsp;update&nbsp;@angular/cli&nbsp;@angular/core&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>9) What is the UrlSegment Interface in Angular 7?</h3>

            <p>In Angular 7, the UrlSegment interface represents a single URL segment, constructor, properties and
                methods like this:</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>class&nbsp;UrlSegment&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>constructor(path:&nbsp;string,&nbsp;parameters:&nbsp;{...})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>path:&nbsp;string&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>parameters:&nbsp;{...}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>toString():&nbsp;string&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The UrlSegment is a part of a URL between the two slashes and it contains a path and matrix parameters
                associated with the segment.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>10) What is Do Bootstrap (ng Do Bootstrap) In Angular 7?</h3>

            <p>The ng Do Bootstrap is a new life-cycle hook added in Angular 7 and Do Bootstrap is an interface.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>//ng&nbsp;Do&nbsp;Bootstrap&nbsp;-&nbsp;Life-Cycle&nbsp;Hook&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>classApp&nbsp;Module&nbsp;implements&nbsp;Do&nbsp;Bootstrap&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>ng&nbsp;Do&nbsp;Bootstrap(appRef:&nbsp;ApplicationRef)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>appRef.bootstrap(AppComponent);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>11) What are directives in Angular7?</h3>

            <p>In Angular7, directives are used to add behavior to an existing DOM element or an existing component
                instance.</p>

            <p><strong>For Example</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Directive,&nbsp;ElementRef,&nbsp;Input&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@Directive({&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;[myHighlight]&#39;&nbsp;})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;HighlightDirective&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(el:&nbsp;ElementRef)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;green&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now this directive extends HTML element behavior with a green background as below:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <pre>

&nbsp;</pre>

            <p>Highlight me!</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>12) What are components in Angular7?</h3>

            <p>Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular app formed like a tree structure. Components are
                subset of directives but unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can
                be instantiated per an element in a template.</p>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>@Component&nbsp;({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;my-app&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template:&nbsp;`&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Learn&nbsp;Angular6&nbsp;with&nbsp;examples&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;`,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title:&nbsp;string&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;Welcome&nbsp;to&nbsp;Angular&nbsp;world&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>13) What is the difference between component and directive?</h3>

            <p>A component (@component) is a directive with a template. Some major difference between components and
                directives are:</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Component</th>
                        <th>Directive</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>If you register a component, you have to use @Component meta-data annotation</td>
                        <td>If you register a directive, you have to use @Directive meta-data annotation</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Components are used to break up the application into smaller components.</td>
                        <td>Directives are used to design re-usable components.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Components are used to create UI widgets.</td>
                        <td>Directives are used to add behavior to an existing DOM element.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Only one component can be present per DOM element.</td>
                        <td>Many directives can be used per DOM element.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>@View decorator or templateurl/template are mandatory</td>
                        <td>Directives don&#39;t use View.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <hr />
            <h3>14) What is a template in Angular7?</h3>

            <p>A template is a HTML view where you display your data by binding controls to Angular component&#39;s
                properties. You can store your component&#39;s template in one of two places. You can define it inline
                using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in
                the component metadata using the @Component decorator&#39;s templateUrl property.</p>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Using inline template with template syntax</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>@Component&nbsp;({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selector:&nbsp;&#39;my-app&#39;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template:&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Learn&nbsp;Angular&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title:&nbsp;string&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;Hello&nbsp;World&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Using separate template file such as app.component.html</strong></p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;Component&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h3>15) What is a module?</h3>

            <p>Modules are the logical boundaries in the application. An application is divided into separate modules to
                separate the functionalities of the application.</p>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong>&nbsp;app.module.ts root module declared with @NgModule decorator</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;NgModule&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/core&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;BrowserModule&nbsp;}&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>import&nbsp;{&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;./app.component&#39;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>@NgModule&nbsp;({&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imports:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&nbsp;BrowserModule&nbsp;],&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declarations:&nbsp;[&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;],&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bootstrap:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&nbsp;AppComponent&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>})&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>export&nbsp;class&nbsp;AppModule&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Here, the NgModule decorator has three options:</strong></p>

            <ul>
